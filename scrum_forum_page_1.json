   "msg": "03:33 pm April 5, 2017\nHello there fellow Scrum enthusiasts,\nThroughout my experience as a Scrum Master, I've worked with many developers who were very happy to broaden their skillset, accept ownership of their team's success, and take the necessary initiatives to self-organize. However, I've also met developers who were in the field because they liked working with software, but who wanted as little to do with the \"management and organization stuff\" as they could. I've heard the phrase before \"Can't we just have someone in charge who knows what they're doing, makes the calls and tells us what to do?\" and I've heard many developers argue that, in their mind, it couldn't work any other way. You can show someone data showing that it does work, but if they're not comfortable with that kind of organization, it's not facts that will change their mind (psychology researcher Jonathan Haidt has a lot to say about that in his research).\nI've read Dan Pink's Drive, and I am aware of what a self-organized team can achieve. Personally, I like to think that I strive for an intrinsically motivating job. At the same time, if someone tells me that what they prefer is a 9 to 5 job that pays the bills and where they can just do what's asked of them, then who am I to try to convince them that they should strive for something else, that they should aim for a different life? To me, that kind of value judgement smells of arrogance and elitism.\nSome people might say that it's fine that some people prefer that kind of job, but that in building an agile organization, these are not the kind of people you want on your team. Alright, I can agree that it's important that people's values should fit with their employer's. What do you do, then, when a CEO decides that the organization will attempt an \"agile transformation\"? Can you really just ask people to adapt or leave? To what degree does the organization have some responsibility to be flexible with its employees different personalities?\nThere might be cultural factors at play too. From its inspiration in Takeuchi and Nonaka's article, Scrum seems to have been influenced quite a bit by Japanese work culture, a country where people, if I'm not mistaken, are often given a job-for-life, and a strong spirit of collectivity. I'm particularly interested in Geert Hofstede's research on culture's dimensions, two of which, the Power Distance and Individualism of a culture, would likely have a large impact on how tolerant people might be to have no central figure of authority and collective objectives. I've also been told by a management professor with cross-cultural experience in Thailand (and I might have understood this wrong) that the Thai Buddhist culture sometimes favours repetitive, brainless jobs, jobs where one can achieve detachment from desires; isn't that in conflict with the core assumption behind self-organized team that people flourish in stimulating jobs? Does it really make sense to try to copy and paste a set of value on people who do not necessarily share these values?\nMy impression is that there isn't a cut and dried solution, but I'd like to hear your opinions on the matter.",

It may or may not be true.\nIf an organization actually needs a Scrum transformation in order to survive, then there seems little point in hedging, because the answer must surely be \"no\". The matter is then one of securing the necessary sponsorship for change, and of communicating the need for it. Scrum requires self-organizing teams which manage themselves using empiricism. The communication of such a necessity is ultimately the responsibility of the organization's accountable officers. A Scrum Master can assist transformation in a number of ways, but there is no button for enterprise change which a Scrum Master can or should push.\nLog in or register to post comments",

Some people will argue the organization has responsibility towards noone but its shareholders; that's a whole debate on its own...\nI completely agree with you on the necessity for change sponsorship, and for the communication of the organization's desire to have self-organizing and empirically managed teams. That is, if the organization actually wants those things.\nYou've made me realize that if the organization does communicate clear values and a clear management philosophy, if the organization clearly expresses a desire for an agile transformation, then it is probably reasonable to expect employees to follow those values, even if they are not their own, and to adapt to this new organization.\nWhere I am still hesitant: While I am certain organizations are aware of the potential advantages of an agile transformation, I don't think its potential impact on employees (sometimes positive, sometimes not), and the risks associated with a culture change of that magnitude, are usually well understood. We know agile organizations are usually effective, but that doesn't mean that making your organization agile will be a positive change.\nLog in or register to post comments",

   "msg": "06:41 pm April 6, 2017\nI don't think comparing Scrum with Thai buddhist culture is the right thought they both have their own purpose.\nScrum became popular because its strength lies in the core principles and set of ingredients that make it effective. Once of those ingredients is a self-organizing team.\nIf team member(s) do not believe or do not want to self-organize or take ownership and responsibility it is the role of the SM to patiently wait , coach, train and advocate the benefits of being a self-organized team. I think your opinion about avoiding conflict (a big NO for scrum!) w.r.t their belief system will change once you read books about how to coach your agile team (Coaching Agile Teams - the book - by Lyssa Adkins is what helped me, but there are others like The Five Dysfunctions of a Team by Patrick Lencioni which helps you understand how to deal with team members of different emotions)\nRemember that SMs are not usually given a team of 3-9 CERTIFIED Scrum development team members. I follow the following steps to expose such individuals to the Agile/Scrum IDEOLOGY.\n1) There are numerous online resources/videos and shot exams that will challenge their knowledge of scrum and teach them in the process. Many organizations have certifications and tutorials to pass every year (HIPAA, PHI for example). Talk to management about the problem and propose a certificate program for becoming a scrum development team member. Just like out beliefs have transformed through out coaching and training sessions, their opinions will change too!\n2) Hold lunch and learn sessions and attempt the online exams as a team. As you answer and reason the wrong answers the information discussed and the concepts of self organizing team will repeat and stay ingrained in our minds (example = you and me!)\n3) I never force the belief, I always wait for the right occasion or moment. Some times it could be happy hour discussion about a great football game where the team is in awe of the team effort of players on field! Use that moment to draw analogy of how it can be employed to your team! Use examples of online collaborative video games where people share resources/troops as an example of the experts can train others and others can seek help without fear and hesitation so that all team members acquire and grow their knowledge to form a solid team will all members having multiple skills. As this happens the team automatically becomes self -organized as well!\n4) Team building events greatly helps. When people know about each other other than their job persona things will be eased and they can start taking ownership of things and even enjoy getting things done a a group. The feeling of yours vs mine should be abolished to build a harmonious self -organized cross-functional team.\nLog in or register to post comments",

   "msg": "08:30 pm April 6, 2017\nI didn't mean to compare Scrum to Thai Buddhist culture (it's not a question of whether one or the other is valid), I meant to point out how one's culture and the values carried by that culture can be in direct conflict with the values behind Scrum. My questioning was: in such a case, can you force a set of values upon an individual? If they are the organization's values, perhaps (Dr Mitchell's convinced me here), but what about the cases where that part is not so clear?\nBoth Patrick Lencioni's book and Lyssa Adkins are great. They've shaped a lot of my opinions on what makes a great team and what makes a great coach. I'm not saying I don't believe in the strength of a self-organized team. However, what I do believe is that it's not always in the best interest of all when an agile coach attempts to take a team there.\nA glaring difference I see between agile coaching and some other forms of coaching is that the agile coach must keep in the back of their head the interests of the organization (and the agile transformation), whereas a personal coach, for instance, always puts the coachee first. This makes a difference in the (maybe rare) cases where, for example, it becomes obvious that the coachee does not want to self-organize. If, as a coach, you come in with the belief that you know what's best for the coachee, and disregard their own stated opinion on the matter, is that really coaching? If you have an agenda other than the coachee's interest, when does coaching become salesmanship? When does it become manipulation?\nJust to be clear: I'm not saying to avoid conflict, but perhaps to be mindful of the causes and consequences of that conflict.\nLog in or register to post comments",

In one of the chapters on coaching techniques She advocates of meeting them half step not even one step. What she meant based on my reading is when we have a rule to be followed and even if they have some aspect of it that they like we will stick on to that and build on top of it with patience. Even after all this some people will not be willing to change like you mentioned.\nI guess the only option at this time is to respect each others views and agree to an arrangement that is best for both! I mean I have seen some individuals who do not even believe in Agile to the extent that they wont even yield to have a quick read of my suggestion or join me to an agile webinar or event. Obviously they may want to pursue career at an organization that is not agile. there is no option there.

They help me coach and train.\nLyssa also differentiates between coaching and training , where she attributes training (as if you are training a fighter who WANTS to learn fighting) and coaching as how to best use the skills they already have. Obviously, coaching is a way to apply learning in an informed way. Training is used for things like new-hire orientation, changes in processes, procedures, or technology, and new governmental regulations. So first you train even if they have questions about why they have to do what they are doing (compare this with wax on wax off of the karate kid movie). I guess if the employees are not willing to get trained that means they do not want to CONSIDER agile and therefore do not want to be with the company. As simple as that.\nAnd the best way out of this situation is when you hire the new employee with an Agile need. Now that you mention this hardship of coaching I remember how the new employees always are willing and adapting to the process without much complaints! Because they already know what they signed for and they are in the training mode where they are ready to learn an entirely new or foreign concept with minimum questions (orientation style) unlike the existing employees who need to be connected through their pain points and should really believe that the change will help resolve the problems they are facing in current process. In my experience thought different teams and persons took extremely wide range of times ( days to months and years) to finally get it, they all either got it or left before getting it, but were always engaged in the discussion, because the process of training and coaching never stops for a SM.\nLog in or register to post comments",

   "msg": "10:53 am March 30, 2017\nDear All,\nCleared PSM I certification exam last week with 97.5%, score of 78/80.\nI have decent experience working in Scrum based projects and Certified Agile Practitioner (PMI-ACP). I have taken PSM certification since I want to have something specific to Scrum. I must say I really learned a lot during this exam preparation, during reading the Scrum Guide, I could relate to my experience and found guide very structured way to understand the Scrum framework. To test my knowledge and to ascertain how I would fare in the exam, I have attempted all the Scrum open assessments till I get 100% repetitively. That gave me general understanding of the kind of questions in the exam. I have also attempted PSM I Quiz in Real mode by Mikhail Lapshin in order to get the feel of real exam with total 80 questions.\nSince this is the first certification exam I appeared which is self-proctored in my personal PC from the comfort of my home, so exam feeling was different & also little worried about the power & internet disconnection issue, But fortunately did not happen in my case, I found test GUI OK & questions were loading without prominent time lag, However some look & feel improvement can be made in Test software.\nI really enjoyed the exam with the kind of interesting questions coming in my way, few directly from the Scrum Open assessments. I was able to complete the 80 questions in 30 mins, with around 13-14 marked for review. Then I took some time to understand and answer those reviewed questions. Again cross checked all the 80 questions and managed to finish the test 4-5 mins before time, thinking better to finish it if done, than giving any chance for any disconnection or interruption to happen.\nQuestions were not easy but of intermediate difficulty level with some scenario based. It will really test your understanding of Scrum Guide and ability to apply it in real-world situations. But if you are prepared well & have some practical experience in Scrum, it is not difficult to pass this exam.\nAll the Best for the people who are PSM aspirants. Hope my feedback will help you in your preparation for your PSM exam and Scrum journey.\nThanks,\nPranab Chakraborty, PMP, PMI-ACP, ITIL v3F, PSM I",

   "msg": "03:23 pm April 6, 2017\nI came here to make a similar post, but perhaps by adding to the thread it will serve as a better resource for others.\nI also recently passed PSM-I. Obviously there is some great advice in these forums, so I will try and not repeat those.\nIn addition to the standards of reading the Scrum Guide and taking the Open Assessments for Scrum Master and Product Owner, I used the following resources -\n- Read the book \"Software\" in 30 Days\n- Read the book \"Scrum\" by Sutherland\n- Read the book \"Scrum Narrative and PSM Exam Guide\" by Mohammed Musthafa Soukath Ali (and read his associated pocket guide)\n- Subscribed for one week to BostonAgileTrainings Mock tests, which I believe was $10. I did not use their training material.\n- Used the practice tests at mlapshin.com\nThere are other resources out there, and you really need to be careful about what you use. For example, I had a copy of the Scrum Master Training Manual from Mplaza that listed 6 Artifacts. A different version I had showed the correct listing of Artifacts. So, whatever your resources, make sure they are current and up to date.\nAdvice on the forum is pretty solid all the way around. Take the open assessments until you get 100% all the time. These not only give you a feel for the format of the test, but I probably had at least 10 or 15 questions that were straight from these open assessments, so those are pretty much free points.\nI really found the best resource to be the book by Ali. He actually tries to guide te reader into an active learning process, which is what you need to do. Essentially, for every sentence in the Scrum Guide, you need to ask yourself \"what does this mean in an applied setting, how would I actually use this?\" If you can begin to internalize that concept while reading it will take you a long ways. Conversely, while taking a test, you invert this idea and ask \"what concept in the Scrum Guide does this question speak to?\" The test is very much asking you to apply Scrum principles.\nI advise reading the Scrum Guide and Ali's book before reading the \"Scrum\" and \"Software in 30 Days\" books. I found the utility of the latter two books to be in the application and execution of Scrum, which is much easier to understand when you have the knowledge of the construction of Scrum. Not to mention that they are fun reads and show actual successful transformations to Scrum, which gives an added real world view.\nI also advise picking two or three sample exams and doing them until you pass with 90% or better. However, hold one set of sample exam in reserve. So, if you pick 3 exam sources, practice 2 of the 3 regularly. Then, right before taking the real exam is when you want to take the final set of practice exam. The reason is that the more you practice anything, the more you will start to learn those questions, those answers and that style of question. So, you might be scoring very high but that could be just because you are starting to learn the right answer. Holding one test in reserve will force you to apply knowledge in an unfamiliar setting, which is what you want before the real exam.\nI also advise as you engage our learning process, start to build yourself a \"1 pager\" based intially on the Scrum Guide. Sure, you can find plenty of one page slides online, but there is a part of learning that comes from your own captue and recreation of information. After you make this one pager, keep it next to you as you read other materials and use it as a reference, making notes and updating the one pager through the process.\nAs humans, we tend to prefer our learning to be specific, and fact based as opposed to concept based. This will throw you during the real exam if you aren't careful. You will see questions, and question patterns that look familiar but if you don't read every word, it will trip you up.\nFor example, you might see a question that asks about Done for a Product Backlog Item, which might be different than Done for a Sprint Backlog item. If you are disposed to thinking about DoD for Sprints and Sprint Backlog Items, you really need to think about this for a minute before answering. You need to read every word of a question and don't make the mistake of thinking that you recognize the question based on some key words and thus know the answer.\nAlso for example, you might see a question about treatment of Non Functional Requirements and you think \"oh man, I read three books and not one of them mentioned NFRs, what do I do?\" Again, the answer is to apply the principles of Scrum. I would argue that NFRs, Functional Requirements, or Whackadoo Blue Moon Chupacabra Requirements should all be treated the same way if they are delivering value to the customer.\nFinally, right before testing, re-read the Scrum Guide. As many others have said, every word and every sentence is chosen carefully. I did this and there were at least 3 questions on the exam that used language straight out of the Scrum Guide that I was able to recall because I had read it 10 minutes before.\nWell, that is a bit more than my 2 cents. I tried to give you some food for thought, but without revealing any testing specifics. I hope this helps and is a unique perspective.\nLog in or register to post comments",

The spectators however are briefed in advance that they are not expected to talk.\nRegarding the PO: It largely depends on the person. If both he and the developers see a benefit in it, he of course is there (usually to answer questions right when they surface).\nLog in or register to post comments",

However, after the Daily Scrum is over, other brief meetings are just added ad hoc.\nI've seen this as well, and I think it is generally a good thing, especially if it is mostly ad hoc meetings organized by the Dev Team. I've heard this concept called \"The after meeting.\"\nSome things potentially harmful to Scrum to watch out for with this practice:\n* Authoritarian type managers/execs/PO's who might \"hover\" to silently observe the Daily Scrum might be tempted to exert command and control in the after meetings, or require an after meeting every day to exert such control.\n* Be careful of developers discovering impediments the previous day but *waiting* until the DS/after meeting to deal with them. The best way to remove impediments is to handle them immediately if possible. Coach your team to always be removing impediments, and not just waiting until the DS to do so.\nOther than those two anti-patterns above, the \"after meeting\" is a great concept, and as Daniel said, it helps keep the DS itself very short. Even on larger(9-10 devs) distributed teams that I've coached, they were able to keep their DS to 10 minutes or less.\nRegarding the DS, it is also worth noting that a) there is no requirement that it be a standup meeting, though that is often a great practice and b) there is no Scrum rule against solving impediments within the DS. So long as you can keep it to the 15 minute time-box, and the conversation is on topic for DS content (yesterday/today/impediments), you can do whatever you want in that meeting.\n-------\nCharles Bradley\nhttp://www.ScrumCrazy.com\nLog in or register to post comments",

   "msg": "03:23 pm November 8, 2012\nFredrik,\nbut I am questioning the reason why the scrum guide explicitly states that the DS is for dev team only.\nFredrik, I think you are very right to ask this question, and it's a good one. The short answer is I don't know exactly why the Scrum Guide was written that way, as I was not involved in writing that part of the Scrum Guide.(or any other part, to date, though I have given some feedback to Scrum.org on occasion).\nHowever, here is my guess, based on my Scrum knowledge and experiences:\n* The Dev Team(DT) has no other Scrum event where it is just them exclusively, so to ensure that they have every reasonable opportunity at self organization, the Daily Scrum was explicitly described as only the DT participates.\n** Having anyone else participate, especially people who might be viewed as authority figures (SM, PO, Managers, etc) carries the risk of completely destroying the self organization of the DT. Giving any of these authority figures even the slightest daylight in the Scrum Guide would probably encourage them to try and participate. I think it is ok for the SM to facilitate the DS for a team that is learning, but facilitating is not the same as participating(as in, answering the 3 questions, etc).\n*** Along this theme, having any other authoritative figure present also runs the risk of the DS turning into a status or \"report up\" meeting, which is definitely NOT what we want.\n** I'll go one step further. I'd prefer that no one else(besides the DT, and the SM when needed) be *present* at the DS, because it discourages transparency. People who are being observed by an authority figure will not be as transparent as those who are free from such observation.\n* The purpose of the DS is to inspect and adapt the plan. Many studies have shown that when a team is empowered to self organize to provide it's own plan, it is much more likely to execute that plan well and on time. Introducing others means reducing the empowerment, IMO.\n** The PO has no role in coming up with the plan -- only the ordering, definition(acceptance tests), and clarification of PBI's. The PO has all kinds of influence over the \"WHAT\", but only the Dev Team owns \"THE HOW\". Therefore, one might say that the DS is for the \"HOW', and not for the \"WHAT\".\n* Since we often want the PO to be someone empowered, from the business side of the house, it may be impractical to require them to come to the Daily Scrum -- because of their business side duties. OTOH, IMO, there is no such thing as too much communication between the PO and team. IME, very few Scrum teams can get along well without a lot of interaction with the PO. Maybe the DS is just not the appropriate time for it. Let's remember, the DS is only 15 minutes, so there *are* another 7 hours and 45 minutes of the day(typical US work day) when the PO can collaborate with the DT. I mean, you could have a PO Q&A just before your DS(so long as it does not impact the DS in any way -- and that includes the DS start time) every day, if you're really worried about PO decision affecting the plan. However, the reality is your team should be interacting with the PO *whenever* the PO is needed. While the PO need not be present all day every day, they should be pretty highly available all day every day, IMO. In summary, there is a very wide range of how much actual time a PO spends with a team or managing the backlog. As such, taking them out of having to participate in the DS allows for POs who also spend a fair amount of their time with stakeholders or in non Scrum team/business activities.\nMany of the obstacles you mentioned can be solved in other ways besides at the DS.

This seems to have a positive effect on the team; it shows they are connected and committed as Scrum Team members. But if they join, behave as every other Scrum Team member. So, don't start leading the meeting. I ask them to answer the 3 questions from their perspective. It keeps the others informed, and it helps to keep the Product Owner to be accurately informed which is quite helpful for his/her stakeholder management.\nAnd don't forget that the 3 questions are indeed only a means to get the right information in the open.

   "msg": "04:51 am April 5, 2017\nOfficially there is no clearly defined minimum, but you have to consider the time it takes to hold retrospectives, planning, and backlog grooming as well as the (presumably largest) phase of actually doing the work. Also, since new sprints start at the end of the previous sprint, having sprint durations that aren't a multiple of 5 days means having them start and end on different days. Inconsistent timeboxes are not ideal.\nIn my opinion, I'd draw the line at 1 week (5 days) as a practical minimum. Yes, you can technically manage shorter sprints, but I think Scrum loses a lot of its effectiveness when you attempt to do this.\nAs for the second question, regarding what happens if sprint backlog items don't seem to match a sprint goal, my understanding is that you could potentially approach it in three different ways:\nThe Sprint Goal doesn't accurately reflect the goal for the sprint, and should be revised.\nThe original Sprint Goal is no longer relevant, and the sprint should be canceled.\nThe Sprint Backlog items don't match the Sprint Goal, and should be left in the Product Backlog for a future sprint.\nThe Sprint Goal is an objective that will be met within the Sprint through the implementation of the Product Backlog, and it provides guidance to the Development Team on why it is building the Increment.\nLog in or register to post comments",

What if we have multiple items that are not related to a single goal and are estimated to be a few hours worth of work. Would we not waste an entire sprint for such small tasks?

What would your potentially releasable increment look like if you had no backlog items?\nIf you're wondering about the technical \"scrum way\" to handle this, the Scrum Guide would prefer that you cancel the sprint for having an obsolete (nonexistent) sprint goal, over and over. Or, it would tell you to close out the project and open a new project for the same product once have enough backlog items to perform a couple of sprints. If you think those options sound inefficient and messy, you're right.

Thank you for the clarification. In a complex environment (and not a complex single product), moving the team over to another product would meet the definitions of Scrum a lot more cleanly, and probably be the preferable way to handle it over the much messier product-based methods I had suggested.\nI also see the primary cause for my confusion, which I'll share for anyone who falls into the same thought process.

When you sign up, you will start receiving an email per day from Kane Mar with a link to short videos which are less than 5 minutes.\nHere's how I prepared for the exam.\n1. Printed out the Scrum guide\na. Read the Scrum Guide on the train while heading to work.\nb. Tried Scrum open assessment and no doubt, didn't pass!\nc. Read the guide again, this time managed to get close to 90%.\nd. Learnt which questions I was going wrong from feedback which you get after completing Scrum open assessment.\nc. While looking for free study material, got hold of this book -\" The Scrum Master Training Manual\" by Nader K. Rad and Frank Turley ( Management Plaza). it's free and just 35 pages.\nf. Tried Open Scrum assessment and got 100%. After which I was consistently hitting a 100%\ng. Tried Open PO assessment (15 Qs) and got 70% which made me realise that I was not ready yet So,\nh. Read Scrum Guide again and got 100% consistently in Open PO assessment as well.\nRead the Scrum guide like 6 times before I took the exam and yes, I didn't buy any other material to practice.\nYou may have to unlearn few things that you know about Scrum and Please don't read multiple books this will only help you get confused. You just need to understand Scrum Guide.\nHope this helps anyone taking the exam.",

There was no mention of the Manifesto for Agile Software Development or The Scrum Guide.\nSoon after, I found and read The Scrum Guide. I read it several times, challenging myself to understand the \"why\" of each of the roles, events, artifacts, and the rules. I would ask myself, \"What benefits would be lost if XYZ were removed from the framework?\"\nMuch as the Manifesto came after Scrum, I found it and invested the similar effort into understanding it. The history provided at that site was beneficial. It was a common sense set of values and principles very easily consumed.\nThe Open Assessments were a great test of my knowledge. If I missed a question, I reviewed the applicable areas of The Scrum Guide and took time to further evaluate my understanding. Other sources seemed to contradict or diminish the simple beauty that was the power of the Scrum framework.\nOf course each person has their own journey to enlightenment. I wish y'all well.

After a first couple of reads, I gave the http://mlapshin.com/index.php/psm-quiz/. The test helped reveal that I should be reading the Scrum Guide more closely which I did and then attempted the PSM 1 Open Assessment. I did not get 100% which made me look for more resources. From this forum I came across a book: Scrum Narrative and PSM Exam Guide by M.M Soukath Ali. I bought this over Amazon and gave it a few days to read. It helped as it slowed down my pace a bit, letting the concepts sink in better. Moreover the qns after every page or so, helped in active learning. Its full fledged assessment at the end also helped challenge the understanding of concepts. I read the Scrum Guide again after this book and tried PSM Open assessment and now I scored 100%. I checked myself over a couple of days giving PSM Open assessments and consistently got 100%. Thinking I might not be covering well inspite of getting 100% in PSM Open Assessment, I gave the PSPO Open assessment and Nexus Open assesment. I did well in PSPO (got 2 wrong) but rather poorly in Nexus. I didnt try Nexus again. I also tried the Developer Open assessment and did very poorly there but I can for sure say that its not needed for PSM 1 exam. Even Nexus is not needed but it will not harm if you give the test once just so that you are aware of some concepts. PSPO Open assessment is not a must have but doing it once will help in building the confidence. I did not use any other resources other than the ones mentioned above. I will suggest going through some other scrum.org resources (which are very quick read) towards the end will help revise the concepts - https://www.scrum.org/resources/ways-learn-about-scrum.\nBest of luck in passing PSM 1 certifications for those who are planning to do it.\nLog in or register to post comments",

People often act on their \"best behavior\" when an executive is sitting there, and may not want to make waves or complain about genuine problems for fear of the high visibility. Scrum events lose their value when everyone wants to look like a \"team player\" and a \"yes man\" rather than actually address problems and progress in Scrum.\nPeople like to interject their own thoughts, even if they're supposed to be attending as silent observers.

However, if doing so requires a significant amount of effort (research, testing, development, infrastructure, addressing technical debt, etc.), then it probably makes sense to represent it in the Product Backlog . . .perhaps it is an \"epic\" or \"theme\" size initially and later refined into multiple, focused items. New work can be accomplished with the future Definition of Done in mind while the rest of the product is addressed.\nSimilarly with the other non-functional requirements noted above. Perhaps a software framework or component upgrade wold be beneficial to the users. While sometimes difficult to phrase as customer value, they can be important to delivering working and valuable software.\nLog in or register to post comments",

In other words there may be elements of a single NFR which apply to every increment (and are thus assertions which must hold for Done), and other elements of the same NFR which constitute scope.\nFor example, a life-critical system may require a certain level of resilience. No increment may be considered Done unless it demonstrates that resilience. However, building that resilience in the first place may require the implementation of fail-over components which would be a matter of scope. A DoD asserting such resilience could only be applied once a Sprint Increment (e.g. the first one) is available which implements that scope.\nLog in or register to post comments",

I have used below methods in various teams and they worked pretty well:\n1. Avoid going toward all hierarchical structure (e.g. involving management).\n2. Talk to each individual and try to give them enough motivation by explaining how important is everyone's job in the success of product.\n3. Invite the team once per two weeks for dinner or a kind of social activity.\n4. If someone is late in a meeting, define a rule (however we are not really allowed to define our own rules according to SCRUM), that the late member should bring chocolate next time.\n5. If people are giving too many pauses to themselves at coffee machines or etc. just explain to them how important they are and pausing their job is actually lowering the overall performance.\nAs an overall advise, I would tell you be really careful of 'Toxic Employees'... don't let the situation get out of control where toxic employees take control. If you have this situation, it would be another subject.\nGood luck and let me know if you have any questions.\nLog in or register to post comments",

   "msg": "02:33 pm September 27, 2012\nThe question can be answered this way:\n\"You will get what will be done up to the budget limit!\" In scrum, each sprint will deliver potentially shippable increment to the product. This means that if the product backlog is well prioritized, high-value features will be done soon during the project, resulting in a product that quickly has value. Each sprint will add value to the product. When the budget is reached, normally you should have something to deliver. Maybe it will not offer all the inital features you were expecting, but maybe you could be surprised to finally deliver more, or even better, deliver something that fits the customer needs better!\nNow... This question is often biased by a subsequent or underlying question: what happens if the budget is fixed, the timebox is freezed and we promissed to deliver all the functionalilities? This is what I call the \"iron triangle\", no variables, only solid-framed limitations... Get prepared to negociate! This is what agile tries to change!\nLog in or register to post comments",

   "msg": "09:38 am October 9, 2012\nGood morning, Leo.\n(I really hate the expression \"In a perfect world\", but...) In a perfect world, \"You will get what will be done up to the budget limit\" is fine. In the real world... I have been consulting in software development for 34 years and I have never met a manager who would stand still for that.\nThis is a question to which I have yet to find a satisfactory, or even marginally satisfying answer.\nMost engineering and manufacturing companies, that aren't pure \"think tanks\", when they envision a new project to develop a new product, have a time and cost budget in mind beyond which it is no longer time-effective or cost-effective to develop the product. Maybe they have to get it out into the marketplace by a certain time or they lose their window of opportunity. Maybe the product has to sell at or below a certain price point or no one will buy it.\nMost Agile (upper-case \"A\") processes emphasize the time to complete the next increment (the next \"sprint\" or whatever one wants to call it) and don't pay much attention to how long it is projected to take to complete the whole project. Ditto costs... most Agile processes don't seem to pay significant attention to development cost targets.\nSo, precisely HOW is it that one convinces senior management of the benefits of Agile processes when the managers' major focus (it's in their job descriptions) is on time-to-market and total cost figures?\nNote the difference between \"Agile\" (upper-case \"A\") and \"agile\" (lower case)... I consider the former to mean a defined process that conforms to the Agile Manifesto. The latter is what most people, particularly software managers, mean when they use the term... at best, they take it to mean \"anything that is faster than how we have done it before\" including any of the iterative processes that have been in use for decades.\nEric Poole\nwww.rkt-tech.com\nLog in or register to post comments",

   "msg": "09:51 am October 18, 2012\nHello.\nI'm quite new to scrum, but I'm really trying to learn by reading and reading and participating in trainings, so my thoughts are:\nScrum does not mean \"no plan/no estimation\" In the beginning of a product development you have to figure out what the needs of a customer are, and of course, they are estimated.\nNevertheless it is clearly stated, that those estimates are only rough estimates to get a plan how many sprints you need to deliver if you know the velocity of your team.\nI know, this does not sound like scrum estimates are really exact, but in my experience with waterfall projects I found the same but with more investment in the planning, because the best IEEE-requirement-sheet always only says \"it is as described if nothing changes!\"\nSo my project planes in waterfall most of the time show something like \"exact dates\" but this is an illusion MS project gives me ;-)\nI heard about an interesting presentation about selling this agility to the customer: Jeff Sutherland talking about \"Money for nothing, Changes are free\" google it, I think it's quite interesting.\nSo estimating (and fixed price projects are much about estimating) is always hard and the bigger the project and the more unknown a domain is, the harder it gets. But scrum does not make it harder, it makes it faster and more flexible.\nmay I was able to bring a few things/thoughts in this discussion.\nBr,\nPhilipp\nLog in or register to post comments",

   "msg": "01:14 pm November 11, 2012\nEric, one could have a good enough Product Backlog holding requirements and other ideas to build into the product, consider expected team size, look at past velocity or comparable figures to figure out the estimated #Sprints and have an indication of timing and cost. Actual implementation is still required to validate all these assumptions. If time and budget have been fixed, scope will become negotiable. Product Backlog and progress on it (e.g. burn-down) will keep all involved informed about the feasibility of the initial plan.\nThe amount of detail that's put in the initial Product Backlog depends on the level of trust in general. Creating an exhaustive, fully detailed Product Backlog is not helping much but may be required. Do note that this is not an obligation posed by Scrum, but a decision taken outside of Scrum.\nLog in or register to post comments",

   "msg": "09:54 am November 13, 2012\nMy 2cents worth: The problem with Fixed Priced Bids is that it is based on a contract...and therefore the contract takes precedence over everything else. This would go against the AGILE Values of valuing customer collaboration over contract negotiation. In my experience (at various clients), once the AGILE mindset and the thinking behind scrum is explained to the client, the need or demand for a fixed bid price is dropped in favor of the client being able to continuously 'direct' the product. This is the value of SCRUM and AGILE in my world. Alas, Fixed price contracts are going to be around for a while though...\nLog in or register to post comments",

   "msg": "03:57 pm November 28, 2012\nI recently applied Scrum within the DSDM framework to support public sector fixed price contracts. Essentially, this was done by treating a Sprint as a DSDM delivery timebox, and therefore as a trading space for negotiating requirements in or out of scope. Cost and time were fixed, but scope became variable. The tradeable scope consisted of the Should and Could requirements of a MoSCoWed sprint backlog.\nAdmittedly this was done before the Scrum Guide changed from sprint commitments to forecasts, but I suppose it might be possible to do something similar by placing the contractual emphasis upon sprint goals rather than upon a sprint backlog.\nFixed price work certainly presents challenges for agile practice, but I agree that it is going to be with us for a while yet.\nLog in or register to post comments",

   "msg": "06:06 pm October 20, 2016\nTypically here is what we have seen:\nIf you fix cost/price and time (time is cost really assuming fixed team) and deliverables, then you can only affect quality (assuming fixed team or team changes wouldn't have significant impact). That is bad. So optimally you develop trust with your customer and fix budget and time and incrementally deliver. Because estimation for work further away is not optimal this is the best case.\nHowever if your customer doesn't trust you yet to honor your commitments then you need a really experienced and stable scrum team with extremely consistent pointing skills. Then it is possible to take epics, break into stories and fix price many types of projects assuming the amount of research is minimal.\nSo if you are doing your fifth inventory system as a stable team it's doable using velocity based planning. Otherwise, you end up just lying to yourself and your customer and continuing the vicious cycle of them not trusting you or constantly compromising and trading off.\nLog in or register to post comments",

   "msg": "11:25 pm October 20, 2016\nFirst question is what and who was used to Estimate the project to come up with the Price? Is it based on what a project of this size would cost when your usual project methodology was used?\nIf it's a project that only has the budget of what's left in the kitty, then it becomes a bit tricky.\nThe emphasis in my opinion should not be so much on the SCRUM Master, but on the Product Owner. He or she should be very mindful of the scope and therefor what can be done with the limited budget. If the business only has money for the basic version of the Toyota Camry, then the expectation should not be that the Deluxe version can be delivered, just because SCRUM is flexible in the requirements.\nOne of the main objections of using SCRUM is that the more experienced developers don't like it and many say that it 'dumbs down' their work... they may be right. For a fixed price SCRUM project that might be an advantage as you could get away with hiring less experienced and therefor less expensive developers... just a thought.\nLog in or register to post comments",

   "msg": "01:22 am October 21, 2016\nNicko, never heard of experienced developers not liking scrum. I have heard of less informed experienced people not liking scrum because they don't really understand it as well as they think. They put the emphasis on the ceremonies instead of the planning and measuring and communication aspects. However it has been shown that a team that has a strong set of values and purpose are for more predictable in terms of productivity than experience alone. So I would rather have a focused set of less experienced developers that are motivated and focused and clear on our objectives and how we are going to execute our work than a bunch of experienced developers that want to act as independent silos and just code.\nOf course experienced developers who are focused, clear on the objectives and truly understand the Agile mindset and have a long track record working together as a cohesive team would be best...\nLog in or register to post comments",

   "msg": "02:21 am November 2, 2016\nSometimes FP is associated with waterfall. And it's partly true, 'cause you cannot make an FP bid if you don't know the requirements. But the question is about running a FP project, not initiating it.\nI like the comparison heard somewhere: it is like a vacation. You have a budget and a time -- and it's up to you what you do tomorrow: relaxing, driving,hiking, or something else. It'll be over when you achieve the goal, or spent your budget.\nI'm applying Scrum on a FP project. Have contract, have timeline, have predefined set of modules to deliver, and have estimates for each of them. When we have stories/requirements ready - we review them with the dev team against the original estimates on the BL refinement meetings. It's a good point to review the complexity and make a decision to lower/higher the grain. The result can be compared with the original plan, so I can even do EVM.\nFrom other perspective - it's a little bit more challenging when the scope is changing (creeping). If it cannot be aligned with the original limitations - then the only right thing for me is to review the contract with the counter-parts and to execute an amendment if possible.\nLog in or register to post comments",

   "msg": "06:16 pm April 3, 2017\nHi all, thanks to those who have answered questions here in these forums, because I was able to pull up so many questions and read clear explanations and get links to sections of the guide or other examples that helped me understand concepts during my studies.\nI took six days to prepare for the exam, I was familiar with Agile concepts and have used Agile Management on certain projects since 2013. I chose Scrum.org over Scrum Alliance because of the more serious assessment and my research indicated the materials here are an improvement and evolution of the CSM materials. I am pleased with my choice.\nThe materials I foccussed on to prepare were:\n1) Read the Scrum guide six times completely, and referenced it numerous times when going through study guides or practice exams. I made sure to read the scrum guide again one more time before sitting the exam because this is the bible in terms of the assessment.\n2) I bought the kindle book Called Scrum Narrative and PSM Exam Guide - by Mohammed Musthafa Soukath Ali and read parts 1 and 3 and did the 80 question exam at the end. I found this book to be confusing and some of the questions had the author's personal interpretation of the Scrum Guide in the content and answers. I couldn't verify all the answers in Scrum.org writings or in the Scrum Guide directly and didn't necessarily agree with his interpretations. Unless you're already feeling comfortable at a fairly deep level with other Scrum materials I wouldn't pick this book up.\n3) The online help attendant at Management Plaza was great in setting me up on their PSM Preparation Practice Exam bundle and I did each of their 80 question exams (3 different versions) at least three times until I was scoring between 92 and 97%. They also have a free Training Manual that was a very well written and laid out expansion on the Scrum Guide that I read twice and made notes from. Overall I found the content from Management Plaza to be very high and I recommend the two products I studied from, they both definitely helped me pass the assessment. They also have an online course that is more detailed but I didn't buy that.\n4) I took the Open Assessments for the three Scrum Team roles multiple times. The one for Developers gets into detailed technical tools and that won't appear on the PSM assessment but there were good questions in there about the Scrum Team roles and the events so it's worth doing this for practice anyway. The Product Owner open assessment is good to take multiple times too. Make sure you're consistently getting 100% on the Scrum Master and Product Owner open assessments before you take your exam. There were a good number of these that appeared on my actual exam so it's great practice.\n5) Mikhail Lapshin has a free 80 page practice exam that I recommend highly. It uses exact terms from the Scrum Guide and has very good explanations of the correct answer, again using terms from the Scrum Guide. There was almost no interpretation here, and I felt confident I wasn't getting confused or misled by practicing on this exam. Take it until you're getting over 95%. Make sure that if you want to review your answers that you do so BEFORE you hit finish. There is no option afterwards to read correct answer, you can't go back and see the questions either.\nSOME TIPS FOR WHEN YOU'RE TAKING THE EXAM\na) Don't think you can google for the right answer. You should be able to rely on your notes to confirm tricky questions, if you know the Scrum Guide very well you'll be able to get to the relevant section where a lot of the answers lie. But you need to get through the whole exam before you start trying to look things up. Save that time for tricky questions to the end.\nb) Read carefully about how many answers you should select. And select the BEST answers. Often there is an additional answer that might also be true, but is not the most critical answer out of your options. Make sure to read whether you're being asked to pick TRUE or UNTRUE statements out of the answers. You need to read the question twice before you start picking options.\nc) When it comes to questions involving the Development Team, lean towards them being in full control of the Sprint Log, HOW they will work, what work they add to the Sprint log, they don't update stakeholders outside of the Sprint Review... they have their heads down creating the product during the sprint. In your answers understand that their time is shielded by the Scrum Master who makes sure that the organization understands how to interact with the Development Team (let them do their thing) and the Product Owner who keeps the Stakeholders informed. The Development Team manage themselves.\nd) Print the Scrum Glossary and have it with you. Print the Values poster and have it with you. Print the Scrum Guide and have it with you. Take your own notes and organize them into \"Roles\", Artefacts, Events, Rules. Have them with you. Lay all your info out in a way that you know where to go to grab each resource when you need to.\nDON'T BOTHER WITH:\n1) You don't need to read the recommended books in the knowledge areas link, you'd take months to prepare for the assessment if you did. For your ongoing improvement in Scrum then certainly pick up whichever ones you find interesting\n2) Avoid the SBOK Scrum Body of Knowledge, it won't prepare you for PSM and mixes other Agile domains\n3) Don't pay a lot of money to take any online prep courses. If money is no object to you then go ahead with an in-person course in your area, and sit the exam shortly after and you should have a good shot at passing. But there's no reason to pay over $300 for a prep course to get ready for a $150 exam.\n4) Don't sit the actual exam until you're consistently getting 100% on the open assessments and mid 90s on the other practice exams I listed above.",
