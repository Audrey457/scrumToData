I took the Open Assessment in under 5 minutes, getting 100% every time. This was also useful with time management. The biggest help to me was this link:\nhttp://mlapshin.com/index.php/psm-quiz/learning-mode/\nTake the Learning Mode quiz as much as possible. When you are ready, take the Real Mode as much as you can and make sure you are consistently getting 100%.\nThat was it. I didn't use any other resources but those three. Reading the Scrum Guide and taking those quizzes over and over really solidifies the concepts, which is what you need to answer a lot of the questions.\nBest of luck!"

The next time you hear someone say \"we need to communicate more in this organization\", it's worth bearing this in mind. Such statements should not be considered equivalent to an appeal for \"individuals and interactions\". Chances are it's the dependencies between teams that are the problem, not insufficiently complex lines of communication.\nLog in or register to post comments"

   "messages": "08:22 pm March 27, 2017\nEmpiricism asserts that knowledge comes from experience and making decisions based on what is known.\n...\nHaving more than nine members requires too much coordination. Large Development Teams generate too much complexity for an empirical process to manage\nThe Scrum guide cites those issues with being present in teams over 9 members. These are concerns, not failing points, and a Scrum team of more than 15 members can work. However it won't be as effective as an appropriately sized team. Ideally you'd separate them out into two teams, and follow the Nexus Guide for scaling Scrum out to multiple teams. That is the Scrum.org method for scaling Scrum. You could also look into SAFe, as a second method for agile scaling.\nThe biggest problem you'll find likely isn't the labor, but the events. Keeping a Daily Scrum time boxed to 15 minutes can be challenging with 7 people, and doubling that team size makes it much harder. Expanding the time box is a no-go (after 15 minutes, you start to lose the benefits of a \"stand up\" meeting), and you're going to have to better prepare for the other events by clarifying things in advance.\nAs I understand it, your job as a Scrum Master in this scenario gets harder, but not impossible. You can have a 15-man Scrum Team, but since the events are based on the sprint length and not the team size, you'll find yourself less in the servant role and more in the leader role. You need to put extra focus into making sure things are done efficiently, because you have less room (and less time) in your schedule as a margin of error. Someone going off on a tangent is going to have a deeper impact on a large team than a small one.\nLog in or register to post comments"

The PSM 2 likely goes above the knowledge level you'd need for the SPS, but PSM 1 resources would correlate strongly with Nexus topics. Nexus is all about scaling scrum, so understanding how Scrum functions before scaling it is important to develop a baseline.\nFor resources, this site has two main references you should be looking at, besides the Scrum Guide and Nexus Guide.

The problem may or may not be out of scope for Scrum.org.

That should strongly reduce the likelihood of interference from external sources.\nIf you do experience lag, open a new tab in your browser and see if other websites are equally affected, or just Scrum.org.

Slow loading time can occur for a variety of reasons, some of which we try to address in our Technical Considerations right above where a user is prompted to enter the assessment password. More often than not, the issue is due to company firewall or security settings, which is why the first point we caution against is attempting the assessment from a shared company network.\nEach question is saved individually whenever a user navigates to a different question, so this slightly increases the loading time over other pages.\nJason, your suggestion of opening up another webpage is helpful, but please also note that users in international locations sometimes experience some latency in loading assessment questions. While you may have a solid/fast connection, there are fewer hops for your ISP to load a page from your country versus a page from one of our testing platform's data centers on the east and west coasts of the United States. It will take some time for the intermediary networks and ISPs to assemble the data packets and display a page. It is important to keep in mind that \"the chain is only as strong as its weakest link,\" and it may take a few extra seconds for the pages to load because of this.\nFor more technical recommendations, users can always find the following support article:\nhttp://support.scrum.org/knowledgebase/articles/467796-are-there-technical-recommendations-for-attempting\nI hope we were able to address your inquiries regarding this matter.\nLog in or register to post comments"

However, they consist of three parts:\n1) You will have to pay an initial fee that also covers your first year as a trainer.\n2) There is a yearly fee that also covers the attendance at as many face-to-face meetings with other PSTs as you can and want attend. Those are quite inspiring. This fee should be lower than 1).\n3) For every participant in official courses you have to pay a license fee. So you have to calculate your course prices accordingly.\nI became a PST because I perceived those as the best of the best. Accordingly, one has to live up to that standard. Experience is essential here, in my opinion. I recommend to gather several years of experience with Scrum before applying as PST. Training experience doesn't hurt either: Imagine you stand in front of a class for the first time, the students have highest expectations, and then you suddenly realize that this is not what you want. Neither your students, scrum.org nor you would benefit from such a situation.\nBest\nDominik\nLog in or register to post comments"

My solution was to create a bunch of study questions and study the Scrum Guide and I passed it the second time easily. I then took my notes and created an online practice exam. I have been told it is very helpful. It is very affordable ($9.99 for one-week) and there are also some free practice questions.

Unfortunately, one needs the context, correlations, and thought provoking questions to \"get\" that.\nGoing through these forums on discussions, and looking for explanations from the experts such an ian mitchel, charles, and few more will bring lot of insights that are not just helpful with PSM but also will aid your job skills.\nCurrenlty, I am almost at the point of releasing a book that reveals Scrum with context and correlations using Active Learning technique.

I read the Scrum Guide 4 times carefully (3 english, 1 my native language)\n2. I read several books:\n- A Guide to the Scrum Body of Knowledge (free). I think this is useful if you know the PMBOK and you are trying to \"adapt\" your knowledge to Scrum, but have some \"wrong or off-dated practices \" (e.g. says 6 weeks max, for Sprint) (http://www.scrumstudy.com/overview-of-sbok.asp).\n- The Scrum Master Training Manual (free). Short but practial book I liked it, but also have a wrong approach about \"Done\" definition; says that you can use a different definitions of \"Done\" for several Deveopment Teams working on a single project ( http://mplaza.pm/ ).\n- Software in 30 Days. Book by the all mighty Scrum creators.\n3. I bought the Manament Plaza PSM I Simulated Exams, only the exams with no courses, I don't work for them in any shape or form, ok? I think this was very good practice for me, but they are based on their The Scrum Master Training Manual (mentioned free boo.k), therefore they are wrong about diferent definitions of \"Done\" for several Development Teams related questions, but still very useful.\n4. In the M. Plaza simulated exams, I started with 80%, after 3 rounds of 250 questions aprox, I finished with 95%+ for each simulation.\n5. I took the open test like 6 or 7 times for SM, PO and I got 100% every time (I guess my previous steps worked), I took the devoleper open exam too, getting around 70%-75% (I've been a developer).\n6. I studied my wrong answers (with mentionded books, the official guide, and other internet sources)\nThis was a 1 month process, around 5 hours dedicated every day.\nExcuse my English, good luck!\nLog in or register to post comments"

   "messages": "11:54 am March 14, 2017\nHi Guys,\nDon't get disheartened with your result. I did take the exam 10 days back and passed it in first attempt. As I don't have scrum experience and I haven't taken any exam for quite a while so my confidence level was not much high while appearing for exam. So, to increase my chances, I did the following things:\n1. I read Scrum guide 6 times out of which last and second last time reading was one day prior to exam and two days prior to exam. Initial readings were to learn the concepts and last two were readings were to revise those concepts which I forgot.\n2. I read Ken Schawer's Agile Software Development with Scrum 2-3 times. (But If found it more useful in understanding scrum in terms of examples of implementation)\n3. I took lot of tests - 5-8 times Mikhail lapshin's assessment. I attempted it in both real mode and learning mode.(Always attempt Learning mode just after real mode to check all the incorrect answers)\n4. I took 10-15 times Scrum open assessment, 10 times Scrum PO, 5 times scrum Nexus, 5 times, scrum developer assessments.\n5. I read nexus Guide 2-3 times\n6. I took paid tests of scrum institute. They provided learning videos and assessments with explanations. (Videos were imp to me as I don't have hands on experience of scrum)\n7. I paid to agileprojectmanagementlearning to as well for tests.\n8. I took paid assessments of Management Plaza too. But these I took in last 2 days only.\nThe reason I bought so many paid assessments was that I was out of touch and out of confidence of appearing to exam.\nHere are my suggestions:\n1) Every word of Scrum official guide is important and can be asked, so read it properly. Take free assessments as many times as you can.\n2) Other things for preparation are not mandatory as they depend on preparation techniques. e.g. Tests, Videos, etc. depends on the best way you decide.\n3) Before appearing for exam, calm down your mind and give it with full confidence.\nLog in or register to post comments"

   "messages": "03:30 pm March 27, 2017\nBelow are some of the tips based on my experience:\n1. Try to understand the content of the Scrum guide. This will be your foundation and most of the questions will be extracted from here. It may not be word per word, so it is very important that you understood what the material is trying to convey, not just memorize the words.\n2. As what others mentioned here, try the mock exams over and over again until you get 90 to 100%. This will help you build confidence. Below are the mock exams that I used to practice:\nhttps://www.scrum.org/open-assessments/scrum-open\nhttp://mlapshin.com/index.php/psm-quiz/learning-mode/\nhttp://mlapshin.com/index.php/psm-quiz/real-mode/\nhttps://www.simplilearn.com/agile-scrum-master-exam-prep-free-practice-test\n3. Take note of those items that you failed to answer correctly and review them.\n4. During the exam proper (actual exam), since its open notes, organize those materials that you'd like to refer to when needed.\n5. When you take the exam, go to a quiet room where no one can distract you.\nI took the exam last 02/20/2017 and got a 90% on the first take. Good luck!\nLog in or register to post comments"

   "messages": "07:43 pm March 27, 2017\nMy experience was that I had to take the PSM I assessment twice, with a 76%, then 86%. I hadn't taken any formal training, though I had practical experience, and did the open assessments several times.\nTaking related Scrum public courses (PSD and PSPO) and passing their assessments really helped to cement my understanding of the SM role. Though they are complementary, these are great courses in their own right covering specifics for those roles while reinforcing the core Scrum concepts.\nAs others have said, the Scrum guide is really the basis of the assessments, but it is extremely concentrated knowledge. Much or all of what you'll find asked in the assessments is in the guide, but you have to look for it and really understand the guide, and dig a little deeper behind the words and into the implications and way of thinking.\nI think they are all good assessments, meant to be tough. And given it's a random set of questions, you may just luck out with a slew of similar questions you can answer, or a bunch that you may have a gap in knowledge in.\nI'm starting on the PST route which requires getting 95% on the PSM I, so I had to retake it, getting 98%. I credit that to the courses and assessments.\nCheers and good luck!\nLog in or register to post comments"

What are three things to consider when deciding to move away from such component teams toward feature teams?\na) Productivity may suffer when making this kind of move.\nb) You cannot do Scrum without feature teams.\nc) With feature teams, it is easier to calculate the productivity per team.\nd) Feature teams have less communication overhead.\ne) Getting support from the business side first helps.\n-> I would say b) and d) ?\nThank you for your support!!"

It merely states that \"Getting support from the business side first helps\".\nGiven that a Product Owner must work with a Development Team from the outset, and that a PO is expected to represent business side interests, don't you think that business support for such changes would be helpful?\nLog in or register to post comments"

Could we discuss the following questions for clarification?\n1) Select two ways in which technical debt impacts transparency.\na) It enhances transparency for the Product Owner as a Development Team is not allowed to do additional feature development in a Sprint as long as there is technical debt.\nb) As development progresses and code is added, the system becomes more difficult to stabilize, which results in future work being slowed down in unpredictable ways.\nc) It leads to false assumptions about the current state of the system, specifically of an Increment being releasable at the end of a Sprint.\nd) When calculated and estimated, the total amount of technical debt shows exactly how long until the Product Owner can release the Increment.\n-> I think b) & c), that is destabilize the system and creates false assumptions.\n2) A Development Team selects a set of Product Backlog items for a Sprint Backlog with the intent to get the selected items \"Done\" by the end of the Sprint. Which three phrases best describe the purpose of having a definition of \"Done\"?\na) It tracks the percent completeness of a Product Backlog item.\nb) It defines what it takes for an Increment to be ready for release.\nc) It controls whether the developers have performed their tasks.\nd) It creates transparency over the work inspected at the Sprint Review.\ne) It provides a template for elements that need to be included in the technical documentation.\nf) It guides the Development Team in creating a forecast at the Sprint Planning.\n-> a), b) & f) ?\n3) Which two ways of creating Development Teams are consistent with Scrum's values?\na) The Chief Product Owner determines the new team structures and assignments.\nb) Bring all the developers together and let them self-organize into Development Teams.\nc) Managers personally re-assign current subordinates to new teams.\nd) Existing teams propose how they would like to go about organizing into the new structure.\ne) Managers collaborate to assign individuals to specific teams.\n-> b) and d) because of self-organizing teams?\n4) You have just been hired by a company new to Scrum. Your management has assigned you to be the Scrum Master of six new Scrum Teams. These teams will build one product.

When interpreted that way, then the PO would indeed have the last word. As Britta says, the Development Team is \"only\" responsible for the Sprint Backlog...which is a different artifact.\nOn the other hand, the \"choosing\" of Product Backlog items could refer to the manner in which they are selected when populating Sprint Backlogs. When interpreted this way, then the Development Team would have to pull in work in agreement with the PO. I recommend that people consider this to be the correct interpretation.\nLog in or register to post comments"

Ask the process and procedures department to hand out detailed role descriptions, and the business architects to create a unified set of quality standards for teams to abide by immediately\nc) Bring in an external consulting company to create a plan for all development to be done upon Scrum. Creation of the plan should take no more than 30 days. Execution will be agreed by the company and the senior executives of the company, as they will own the change. Until then no promises of elapse time are possible.\nd) Bring the pros and cons of the merger to the departments and their teams to stress urgency.

The key factor is that the team \"were able to agree on a Sprint Goal, however\". If no Goal had been agreed then the Sprint could not have continued beyond Planning.\nThe minimum output from Sprint Planning that is sufficient for a Sprint to continue is an agreed Goal, and sufficient planning in place for the work towards that Goal to begin. Neither the Sprint Backlog, nor the plan it represents, are expected to be complete. However, a Development Team should not agree to induct work into a Sprint Backlog if they doubt their ability to replan as might be needed in order to attain the Goal.\nLog in or register to post comments"

Nor is a Product Backlog necessarily organized in that fashion, and any assignation of team members by \"expertise\" cannot necessarily be correlated to the matter of design decomposition referred to in the question. Moreover, there is no concept of a \"hardening sprint\" in Scrum. Therefore this answer can be rejected.\n> b) How the organization discusses and plans\n> the work of creating software will be reflected\n> in the implementation of that software.\nThe way in which an organization sets about creating software will indeed have an effect on how it is implemented.

This answer can therefore be rejected.\n> d) There is one Scrum Team for each\n> functional software layer whose job is to co-\n> ordinate dependencies, work allocation, integration, and testing.\nScrum Teams are expected to self-manage their dependencies and any allocation of work, and to be wholly responsible for their own quality of work including integration and testing. It is not reasonable to defer these responsibilities to another team. This answer can therefore also be rejected.\nThe third question was covered in the following thread on 2nd December:\nhttp://www.scrum.org/Forums/aft/1193\n...and again in this thread on 2nd March:\nhttp://www.scrum.org/Forums/aft/1172\nLog in or register to post comments"

This is a human thing requiring deliberate and managed human action. No configuration tool or model can compensate for inadequate co-operation, whether it be within teams or across them.\nIn other words, a version control system cannot be used as a crutch when integrating deliverables into a potentially releasable increment. There will still be a need for the teams involved to collaborate in the selection of work and in the integration of work done. This might involve a \"Scrum of Scrums\" for example, but there can be many other touchpoints including planning, backlog refinement, and reviews, as well as any number of ad-hoc discussions that may opportunistically arise.\nLog in or register to post comments"

   "messages": "02:45 am May 8, 2015\nHi Andy,\nI hear your problem. It can be confusing to contrast the development estimation benefits of Scrum against the external issues of budgeting for a project that hasn't been estimated completely.\nHave you thought about the difference between the responsibilities for budgeting and estimating, as it relates to your team? When I'm working with a Scrum team, the budget usually comes from someone outside the team, who interacts with the developers through a product owner. The team's incremental estimates of what can be done in a given sprint have to be balanced against budgetary constraints that exist outside the team's scope.\nOne nice thing about Scrum as it relates to budget constraints is that a complete slice of functionality is supposed to be delivered at the end of each sprint, so the product owners can take a look at where they are, and go back to the people with the budget to decide whether it makes sense to move forward in the same direction.\nTo address your second question, it's always possible that the product owners will decide that development costs so far have been enough to prove that there isn't a valuable product opportunity, and cut their losses. (Better they should decide that now, instead of waiting until the entire product has been developed, right?) All that means as far as Scrum is concerned is that the team's backlog will need to be shifted to features for a product that is worth developing.\nLet me know if that helps, or if it just raises other questions. It's an interesting issue.\nLog in or register to post comments"

Here goes my $0.2 on the subject.\n*NOTE* It is more from a business perspective and not from Agile perspective but everyone knows that processes and frameworks are created to serve the businesses and not otherwise :)\n1) How do i know my budget without having to analyse all my features?\na) Analyze all your features\nb) Estimate the project as you'd normally do (using any conventional, non-agile methods that you're comfortable with)\nc) Calculate one-month timeboxed cost of iteration. Refer to this article by Jesse Fewell on the subject: http://www.leadingagile.com/2012/11/calculate-budgets-agile-team/\nd) Now you have calculated your budget using two different methods. Use a variable factor to deal with uncertainty, that will come up.\ne) This way you'd know how much margin you're going to keep - now, you can make an offer that makes the business sense\n*NOW, MY NOTE ON SCRUM:* When we execute a project using Scrum, the opportunity is to retrospect at the end of each sprint and ask ourselves - are we going in the right direction? Did whatever we do in the past sprint is of any value from the business perspective? And take corrective actions.\nIn theory, taking corrective actions means that you can stop developing further or pivot if the business value is not found in the delivered increment. Practically, many people (and companies) fear that practice. Which is normal because in business we need predictability although we know that life itself is not predictable - but agile!\nSo, business-people want predictability and budget is one such practical problem so rather than dealing with that problem using agile techniques, we can choose to deal with it using any other conventional technique that works.\nSure, since we're considering agile, then we'd get the cost of iteration and add some variable factor to make some changes but it is, at its best, a kind of guesstimation.\nThis is not a perfect way. This is not where you will get optimum value from Scrum. Scrum framework is effective when the focus is on delivering value, not on finishing something by the budget.\nIf you can, avoid Scrum - or other agile practices - for these kinds of projects. If not, then you can tweak but in that case you're not using Scrum - or agile.\nFor the IT Manager Bob, predictability matters so he would not care which development framework the service provider uses. To win that project, make an offer that Bob cannot refuse.\nIs this Scrum? No.\nIs this Agile? No.\nIs this business? You know it better :)\nIn my opinion, when not to use Scrum is a distinction that every practitioner must have because then Scrum remains a tool, not a magic wand.\nThe war has to be won; does it matter if you win it using Swords or Guns?\n2) Imagen we have a big project where all features were analysed and estimated. A client suddenly decides to stop because of budget reasons. How does a company deal with the lost time?\nWell, this is also a business problem not a framework or a methodology problem. You have a big project. You know your customer. You know what matters to him and what does not.\nIf the client is not wiling to deal with an uncertain next, then Scrum is not right framework for projects where he is involved as @Ian Mitchell rightly pointed out. The reason being, the customer is a key stakeholder and if the key stakeholder does not believe in the practices being performed at a service team level, it is very difficult for the team to make the project successful.\nNow considering the budget question, if I were to deal with such a customer, here's what I'd do:\na) Based on expert judgement, I'd provide a higher level budget / estimation\nb) Based on actual practices, at every small interval, e.g. 1-2 weeks, I keep an eye on the budget / estimation and communicate the same to the customer and take his buy-in on every possible encounter\nc) In a nutshell, I keep Bob posted with what is happening, show him demos and provide him a sense of predictability in the practices that I'm following to execute the project.\nIt is important for Bob to be in good books of his bosses so I'd do everything possible to make Bob win.\nIf I get a chance to talk to Bob's bosses then I'll make sure that Bob gets all the credit for the work my agency is doing on the project.\nThis way, I'll establish a relationship based on personal rapport and trust with Bob and then eventually in next projects I'll have better listening.\nI know that my answers might not \"qualify\" for correct agile way of doing it but I have seen the scenarios you are seeing in practice and the practices (or its variants) have helped me deal with such issues so thought to share my experience.\nLog in or register to post comments"

The infamous waterfall method was in the past the established way to deliver software systems, that's its origin, there's nothing waterfall though about project management in and of itself.\nIn a well designed project multiple parallel activities are often underway whose output is the input to another set of activities, opportunities for parallelism are and should be pursued as the plan is gradually formed.\nI can foresee with scrum situations where team members would be saying \"Oh man, if only we'd known this two months ago, we wouldn't have written X...\" this amounts to wasted time in my view and a PM based approach is always striving to reduce the risk of wasting time, it can and will happen but the process itself (and the PM primarily) is always seeking to uncover uncertainties on a daily basis and taking remedial action promptly.\nLog in or register to post comments"

The only evidence of progress that is considered to be acceptable is the actual delivery of working product. The conditions of high uncertainty in which Scrum has most to offer are stabilised by this means of incremental delivery.\n> I can foresee with scrum situations where\n> team members would be saying \"Oh man, if\n> only we'd known this two months ago, we\n> wouldn't have written X...\" this amounts to\n> wasted time in my view\nScrum allows team members to make these discoveries with each incremental release, and to inspect and adapt product and processes accordingly. An efficient implementation of the framework will reduce the incurral and discovery of such waste to no longer than one calendar month. Less agile approaches would extend this period over which empirical evidence can be gathered. Waste would increase until such time as a release is made and empirical evidence about a product's value can be obtained.\nLog in or register to post comments"

   "messages": "07:33 pm March 22, 2017\nIt's quite old thread but I add 2 cents as this is quite important topic\nLooking on the Ian comments and general scrum approach, it sounds like \"it will be done when we finish, it will cost depending on how long we will work\". It might work fine if you develop own Product or you have very reach customer which does not care if he will spend 100k USD or 1M USD.\nI would like to put here simple example, you want to build house. Would not you like to know how much money it will cost so you can prepare budget for it? Would you just hire construcion company and let's see what we can get? I do not think so, you want to know how much money it will cost you before starting the work.\nCurrently where I work we do two types of projects:\n* own Product continues development - it means all the time we add new funcionality and improvements to our own software, we have own developers - SCRUM is excellent approach for it\n* software development for customers - in 100% of the projects which we do, customers ask for fixed price, they won't accept any other approach because they need to do Buisness value evaluation. How much money I can get from this project and how much it will cost me. They need also to reserve fundings for the project otherwise it can't be executed. It this case as others already mentioned, we can still make full project evaluation, time, resources and cost estmation taking in account that we will use scrum. In this case you have the estimation with all requirements. You can use scrum for development and you can get feedback from customer after each Sprint Review. Do not be surprised if customer do not show up or try the solution 6months later. Customer can ofcourse ask for changes as he finds out that maybe he needs something different. No problem, but then he has to add more money to budget if new changes require more development effort or drop something else so in same budget we can do same job.\nLog in or register to post comments"

If not, how valuable has a fixed price been to the customer?\nThey need also to reserve fundings for the project otherwise it can't be executed.\nCan the customer not set aside a budget for the project up front, based on past experiences and an understanding of the return they expect, also keeping in mind that they may see value in providing more funding at a later date?\nthey won't accept any other approach\nIf a customer simply won't accept an Agile approach, then they won't accept it. They also won't realise benefits of an Agile approach.\nyou want to build house. Would not you like to know how much money it will cost so you can prepare budget for it?\nThe house example is difficult, because adding incremental value is more difficult in the construction industry, as opposed to software. But let's look at it from a basic, livable house (which can be built in a four-week sprint), adding extensions (extra functionality) to the house as necessary.\nKnowing that you'll probably want a house with two extensions (broad road map), you set aside a budget of about 10 weeks of the construction companies hiring costs.\nAfter the first Sprint you see the basic, livable house, provide some feedback, and adjust the road map as required. Meanwhile, you're able to live in the house, already gaining a return on investment. You are now at 6 weeks of budget left.\nThe second Sprint begins and by the end you have one extension. You are now at 2 weeks of budget left. In the Review of the second Sprint, you realise to get the second extension you either need to provide another 2 weeks of funding to your budget or stop the second extension, and finish the project there.\nEither way, you have a working increment which is seeing return on its investment. It is now up to you to determine whether you think its worth continuing the funding for the second extension.\nLog in or register to post comments"

   "messages": "02:02 am March 25, 2017\nWell, let me add my 2 cents. From my reading and understanding of Agile and Scrum, the management and budgeting is more geared from a developers point of view. ( Ian ) You are assuming that all the developers are talented, and only they decide if it can be done and when it will be done. That information is given to the Product Owner who will make the call whether to proceed or not. In other words, the IT team decides whether your software application/project will be delivered that is practical and usable within a certain time. The developers and the Scrum Master are not really bothered about the cost because they are focused on technical stuff and real development work. For them, it is like this. You want this application with these features using this architecture and methodology, this is how long it will take. They would not know the salary of every employee on the team because Scrum assumes for technical reasons that all are developers.\nWhat people fail to realize is that Corporate Management have their own CAPEX (Capital expenditure) for various projects and products that they plan to produce and dole out. And that depends on the type of company and industry. So, they plan at a very high level and it involves the executive branch CFO, COO, CTO etc and VP's of Finance, Marketing, Sales, Manufacturing, Operations, Support etc. Once the projects are approved at the higher level with their milestone, it then shifts to which projects have what priority for that fiscal year assuming that all projects differ in type, size, scope and costs.\nThe responsibility of whether a project then gets approved is with the PMO (Project Management Office) where they do their own feasability studies and comparison with prior projects and costs. Estimation, Costing, Budgeting and profitability analysis and so forth are carried out here. Should we purchase of the shelf package or should we produce in-house?. If we buy off the shelf, who are the reputed vendors, RFPs, what are the terms, conditions and guarantees, after sales support, training, h/w requirements etc.... If we develop in-house, do we have the required architecture, IT Staff, technical know-how, experienced personnel and so on. It is only after that decision is made that an approval is given. And by that time, the company already has a ballpark figure as to how much has been allocated for the project.\nObviously the Product owner who is sitting with Management and the PMO will know what is the allocated budget for that project for that fiscal year. What the Product Owner may not know is what each one employee earns, and will have to make an estimated guess of what it would cost the company per developer x 8hrs. at 40 hrs per week for each Sprint. So an experienced Product Owner is the key player who is responsible for the budget. The PO will need to relay that information to the IT manager and the Project Manager in order to keep track of expenses and time management.\nSo in short, it is not as though one can just throw out some philosophical statements from some scrum guide and expect all companies to just agree to everything in it. That is just a framework which guides the IT team who work on the s/w project. At the end of the day, what is value to an IT team need not necessarily be value to a Management team. A project may be successful in that it was produced on time, and within a reasonable budget. But then the application produced did not or may not have got off the ground for numerous reasons. The users did not find it user friendly, or they were slow to change, or the training was insufficient. It could also be that the company merged, and so the new application was not a priority, and shifted to integration of systems as the parent company felt that their systems were more advanced - Think Oracle / SAP ERP.\nAt the end of the day, all avenues have to be looked at before one can just talk about producing a functional product in increments. After all, Scrum is just a framework within which process and methodology are used to create a quality product. It was never written with the business view in mind. And if a business is not successful, what good is it to concentrate on just executing Scrum?. It has to be balanced with the PMO.\nLog in or register to post comments"

   "messages": "03:13 pm March 23, 2017\n@Ian Thank you Ian, nicely formulated question joining all important parts into one. I belive it does. The only difference between Sprint and other events seams to lie in their formality.\nAnd so whether it is container or not Is not important nor for resolving question nor for the guide context. I think it could be placed under Sprint section rather to its current position.\n@jason Thank you Jason for your opinion, your view leaded me to few new questions, one was really hidden\nis sprint an event ?\nThe guide defines Sprint as event ( see Event section) and also container for other events as you quoted. This was bery confusing for me and I found it originally contradictive. But at the end I belive it is event.\nSo in this sense I would disagree that re-wording the question will help. I concluded that container is not key to question as I am writing above. I thinj that question can\nstays as is but answer includes Sprint or\nis worded as 'check all formal opportunities' and than Sprint is excluded\nAny feedback highly welcomed.\nThank you\nLog in or register to post comments"

   "messages": "02:43 pm March 22, 2017\nWhile backlog refinement is mentioned in the scrum guide in the product backlog section, it is still not listed as an official event beneath daily scrum, review. planning, retrospective (and the sprint as a whole thing).\nFrom my personal experience, it's the best way to do the product backlog refinement with as many members of the development team as useful once a week, having the PO and sometimes even stakeholders available for questions which may rise and be answered quickly. The scrum guide neither tells how the refinement should be done, nor defines a specific time box. So people might do refinements totally differently. But it clearly describes the backlog refinement's purpose and even suggests a maximum amount of overall capacity of the development team to be absorbed by the refinement. So even if the scrum guide does let it open if the whole scrum team should have refinement sessions together, only some members of the team should come together or if everybody should refine item's independently (which I personally wouldn't suggest), there is clearly some kind of an event happening here.\nWhat's your thought on this topic? Should Product Backlog Refinement be entitled an event on it's own instead of only being mentioned in a small section of the product backlog descrption as part of the scrum artefacts? From my point of view, this \"event\" is to crucial to be only mentioned in a side note.\nExtract from scrum guide p. 14:\n\"Product Backlog refinement is the act of adding detail, estimates, and order to items in the Product Backlog. This is an ongoing process in which the Product Owner and the Development Team collaborate on the details of Product Backlog items. During Product Backlog refinement, items are reviewed and revised. The Scrum Team decides how and when refinement is done. Refinement usually consumes no more than 10% of the capacity of the Development Team. However, Product Backlog items can be updated at any time by the Product Owner or at the Product Owner’s discretion.\""

It has beautifully summarized the relationships between Scrum roles, events, artifacts, and the rules of the Scrum framework that bind them together in only 16 pages, it’s easy to think that a quick read will be sufficient but you’d be wrong. If you want to thoroughly understand the entire content of the document-> Read it often.\nScrum.org also provide some valuable resources .\nScrum open - Take Scrum Open assessment exam till you start getting consistently 100%, also look for incorrect answers & reasons behind them.\nDeveloper open- Though I have not seen many people mentioning about this but it’s still worth taking as well.\nI strongly suggest that you do this open assessment as many times as you consistently start scoring 100%. This will help to save some time during the Professional Scrum Master I assessment .\nAlso going through the different posts shared in this forum could be of great help as well.\nI hope this information would be of some help for you.\nBest Regards\nLog in or register to post comments"

There is no requirement for a Scrum Master to conduct events, but rather to facilitate *as needed*.\nIn other words there's nothing to stop a team from rotating the role of an event facilitator between themselves.

Includes issues being found which need to be addressed before starting development work\nThe addition of a new large project which means it is all in the initial analysis stage at the moment, which will take me weeks to understand, talk to stakehokders and start putting together stories\nI'm also working on analysis for a project which will go to a different development team\nThere is no BA in the team so I pick up the detail requirements writing\nThere is a lot of work which doesn't involve the development team I.e. creating user documentation, finance impact etc. Generally looking holistically at the product, similar to a product management role\nAs you can tell, I'm in a sticky situation where either I don't have enough time to do analysis or things seems to be out of my control and have become a bottleneck. Has anyone been in a similar position and can offer any advice?\nMany thanks!"

   "messages": "12:53 am March 17, 2017\nMichal is on to something when he says the \"Fibonacci sequence doesn't make sense.\" It's not something you're used to working with, and it forces you to think about what the number is and how it compares to other numbers. If I tell you one story is an 8, and another is a 4, you would clearly identify the second task as taking almost exactly half as long as the first one. Fibonacci forces you to rethink this because there is no 4. Your choices are 3 and 5. So is it more than half, or less than half? Not as easy to decide, is it?\nAnd the mathematical beauty is that it will never be half. Half of 13 is 6.5, which is exactly the same distance from both 5 and 8. Half of 34 is 17, which is equidistant from both 13 and 21. This pattern continues throughout the sequence. If you ever want to say something is \"half as many points,\" you can't. Fibonacci always requires that you decide if something is more than half, or less than half. That's the point.\nLog in or register to post comments"

Is such precision likely to be realistic, when compared to estimating small work items of 1, 2, or 3 points in size?'.\nMy interpretation of the Fibonacci sequence has always been that as the uncertainty and complexity of the task at hand increase, so does the figure resulting from the sequence. The points increase significantly relative to an increase in complexity and uncertainty.\nThis means that when we assign a low amount of points to a task, we are more certain of the context, difficulties and attributes of that task than when we assign a high number. In your example, assigning in the range of 40+ points means to me that the task at hand is considered to be so large as to making any accurate approximation of that task impossible. T-shirt sizes might be the better choice in this situation. Tasks in that range should be refined to more comprehensible sizes in my opinion.\nHope this helps,\nJames\nLog in or register to post comments"

   "messages": "10:49 pm March 17, 2017\nHi everyone,\nI agree with what everyone said.\nI have the same interpretation as James - having a complex User Story takes into consideration the uncertainty and factors that are not taken into consideration that are far more understood in something that is estimated a lower number.\nIn my experience, it also prevents a false sense of confidence. If you are unsure of what needs to be done, would you bravely give an exact number to present your effort, or do you want to throw a number that could be less accurate to compensate for factors that aren't accounted for in a User Story? Would you rather be roughly right or precisely wrong?\nLet's say you have a User Story A, effort of 1, and a more complicated User Story B. If we estimated it as a 4, that would probably equate to taking 4 times the amount of work to finish compared to A. Could B be broken down to bits of work that make it similar to A? Probably not, and what if B was broken into B1-B4, should B1-B3 reach \"done\" and B4 didn't make it, what are the chances that the result is a potentially releasable?\nFibonacci, paired with User Stories being high-level estimations, gives a more approximate idea (educated guess) of how complex a feature is going to be. In the previous case, B could be a 3 or 5 and there's a clearer idea of how complicated it can be to develop compared to A. In this same case, an effort of 3 or 5 still sounds like a User Story that is standalone and a fully-functional piece of a software on release. You will also see later on that not all 3's, 5's, 8's or 13's take the same length to finish, but they still purvey complexity assumed with those numbers.\nWith Empiricism in mind, you can also use Fibonacci as a means of gauging how an estimated effort translates to work (man hours) in a Sprint. For instance, if you run a 2-week Sprint and have noticed a trend that 5-effort is 2.5 days, 8 is close to 4 days and 13 could be a little more than half the Sprint, then it's possible a 20-effort is a whole sprint to finish or more. This tells us that while a lone 20 could be delivered in a Sprint, it's way too complex, and it's possible to break the User Story into four 5-efforts or an 8 and 13. User Story becomes more defined because of the break down, and you still churn out a working piece of the software.\nI guess a disadvantage of using Fibonacci is because of how the gap changes between numbers, any number over 1 could easily be under or overestimated. I recall in my previous run as Scrum Master in my company, we had instances where (a) a User Story felt like it was somewhere between an 5 or 8, or (b) an 8 would either turn out to be a 13 or a 5 as the Sprint progressed. To air on the side of caution, we always used the larger number.\nAt the end of the day (in the realm of Scrum), proximity is far better than precision.\nLog in or register to post comments"

   "messages": "05:15 pm March 8, 2017\nThanks Vincent!\nRegarding your question on empiricism in creative advertising, I think my team of designers back then were pretty fortunate that we had recurring ad campaigns during a calendar year, and when a campaign would come up, we could look back at the previous times we worked on our deliverables so we can assess what worked/failed/could be improved, and keep those in mind when we started working on that campaign. It also helped us get an idea of \"velocity\" heading towards the campaign's launch.\nWe didn't run sprints back then but we were, in a way, able to design the entire campaign incrementally. If I had to turn the work we did into a Product Backlog for instance, I think what we would have had was:\nFeature: Campaign's Main \"Comp\" (which also would have been a Sprint Goal)\n- User Story: As a user, I want a campaign's main look to represent its visuals and can be translated to different sizes and forms of delivery. Acceptance criteria would be: Contains all important information of Campaign, all sponsor logos visible and sized appropriately based on sponsor type (main sponsor, secondary sponsor).\n- Tasks would have been: \"Create a study of the main design\" (assigned to each member of the team), \"Internal review of design\", \"Have design approved\"\nnext sprint goal would be \"Campaign's design, delivered in all known orientations and sizes (horizontal/vertical)\", then User Stories would have been \"As a user, I want to see a vertical orientation of the design that was suited for large-print campaigns\" or \"As a user, I want to see a horizontal orientation of the design that is suited for web ads\".\nSomething to that extent.

   "messages": "10:38 pm March 15, 2017\nHey Nicolas, I just saw your post.\nImpediments are pretty much anything that could hinder the Development Team from progressing with the work that brings a User Story to the definition of done. Based on experience, it can be both internal and external.\nInternal impediments could be \"workstation is slowing down, so compiling code is taking longer than usual\", or \"I do not know how to approach this specific task\", or \"I'm confused about how the use cases on this user story\".\nExternal impediments can be \"someone asked me to enhance this feature from a previous sprint because they want to demo it for a client\".\nNow we won't be able to immediately get rid of, or be rid of, all impediments as they can and will happen. As Scrum Masters, we need to serve the Scrum Team by addressing these and solving to maintain efficiency towards the Sprint Goal. Some things that have helped me in the past are:\n- Make sure everyone in your Development Team mentions any impediments, but make sure not to go over the timebox for Daily Scrum; gauge if the conversation on the impediment has no resolution, in which case \"park\" the conversation til after the Scrum then discuss it.\n- Always make sure to facilitate discussions and guide the team through what caused the impediment, the effect it has should it linger on, what are the possibilities to resolve it. You don't need to know the answers to everything, but you can bring the team towards resolutions. From the examples I brought up, workstation performance may mean upgrading parts, coding approach might be an opportunity to pair program with another member of the team, use cases can be discussed with the Product Owner to provide clarity.\n- Safeguard the Scrum framework, especially for people within the organization who don't know how it works. In the instance of the external impediment, I would talk to the person who had that request and recommend talking to the Product Owner; while the idea of the enhancement would seem simple enough in their eyes, that is still time away from development, and could easily be underestimated.\nI guess just be aware of what's happening around the Scrum team. Remember, \"Inspection, Transparency, Adaptation\"... if you are able to check what's going on, understand why it's happening and adjust accordingly, then you'll be ready to deal with these impediments.\nHope that helps!\nLog in or register to post comments"

This means the team ought to have all of the skills and resources to do the work, and a self-organizing one will be able to do so without external direction. There ought to be few if any dependencies on the team completing the work by themselves.\nScrum does not mandate the use of feature teams, but recognizes their value in providing feature-complete increments of release quality. It is best left to skilled developers to self-organize into the most appropriate teams for incremental feature delivery.\nLog in or register to post comments"

Nothing beats being there in person or at least being a direct participant.\nIf you have phyiscial rituals, having a facilitator often helps. Whether or not you decide a shared spreadsheet is apropriate for your team, it might still be useful to have your developer email or upload you his responses to the four questions, and you would facilitate his physical participation in the activities.\nIf a team member just can't be there, it might make sense to record the meeting or provide minutes/summaries, so that the person in question can at least derive some of the value they would have by participating.\nMaintaining effective Scrum practices becomes more difficult as you add additional remote resources. If you look at the Nexus guide, you'll see that scaling Scrum is still all about communication, not automation. However since you only have a single remote resource, you should still be able to derive most of the value from your Scrum events, since the majority of your team (2-8 additional members) should still be present.\nLog in or register to post comments"

Most of these meetings are owned by the developers, with some getting input from the product owner. Have any of these members identified this as a concern? Are meetings going out of timeboxes, sprint goals not being met, or your product owner dissatisfied with velocity? Your role as a Scrum Master is to remove impediments, so does the team identify this as one?\nFor activity, it can be tough. Not all people are leaders, and not all people can stay focused in meetings. My only suggestion would be to focus on giving everyone a turn to talk, perhaps using the token round-robin instead of passing it to whoever wishes to speak next. People are self-aware of what they do and say. Shrugging something off or saying nothing is a passive action, but a team member is more likely to notice actively saying \"I have nothing to add\" day after day, and that can indirectly motivate them to change that behavior.\nLog in or register to post comments"

The words in the Guide have been chosen carefully. It's only a short document, but it's important to know it pretty much \"inside out\" before taking the exam. There's a deep meaning to the sentences, and there's usually a reason for why they are written the way they are. You should know not only *what* it says, but also *why* it says it.\nAlso, don't take the exam until you can consistently score 100% on the Open Assessment. For each question, you should not only be able to determine *which* answer is the best, but also *why* the others are wrong or less desirable as options.\nLog in or register to post comments"

The test center for exams is at your own PC where ever you want.\nIf you take a course normally get one shot at the exam. That comes in the form of a voucher to use and has a two week limit on taking the exam.\nIf you didn't attend a course you can register and you normally receive a code within 24 hours, again this has a two week expiry on it. remember 80 questions in 60 minutes so you should know the guide inside out.\nGood luck.\nMichael\nLog in or register to post comments"

This is why prioritization is important - concentrate time & effort on the most important things first, as you might not have time for the other items.\nSprint planning can take up to 8 hours for a 1 month sprint, or less for shorter sprints. However, it can not take 9 hours, as that is over the timebox.\nOnce the timebox is up - the sprint work begins, whether or not they have everything they needed from sprint planning. The timeboxes should give you enough to get started. If they don't, then maybe the purpose of each ceremony is not clear.\nLog in or register to post comments"

They are free to leave after the 7th hour and to engage in productive work. It just means that the clock is still ticking and up to one more hour is available should it be needed. In other words, the limits of a timebox *must* be respected regardless of whether any work remains undone or the team finish early.\nThis principle is important not only for discipline but also for establishing cadence. Sprints, for example, must be timeboxed to start and end at regular intervals.\nLog in or register to post comments"

I'm also in the same boat of trying to pass the test, I'm going through several blogs to understand in detail but I'm still not confident to take the test.\nI did read scrum guide several times, scored Open assessment -100% many many times, working in agile past 3 years, but still not ready to take the test. I'm very skeptical to take any mock tests on other websites outside scrum.org as I'm not sure whether they are right or wrong. But still did attempt few tests, the mock tests are giving me 100% but so scared to give a try after first failure a month and half back.\nFolks who scored 100% or more than 85% can help us giving more tips to pass the test.

My boss has recently tasked me with coming up with what elements of Agile can be applied to a Waterfall environment.

   "messages": "01:36 pm November 20, 2015\nThe fundamental conflict between agile and waterfall is whether there is a commitment to deliver specific detailed scope items by a specific date. There is NO WAY around that. Waterfall is predictive; agile is adaptive. Waterfall is designed for projects without design work -- it makes sense if a new release to a business system requires a staged global roll-out with classroom-based training for 10,000 employees over a six-month period, including printing manuals, arranging classrooms, instructors' visas, etc.... Waterfall is only a bad fit if you're designing something new.\nThe trick is to recognize that you can be a little waterfall-ish before your start building (as long as your charter focuses on success criteria and outer boundaries rather than detailed scope items), and you can be a little waterfall (more likely iterative, most people don't know the difference) on the back end, around the release and support, while being totally agile in developing the product.\nImagine you were hired to sustain a released product: you start your first sprint with an increment in production, with a solution architecture, dev and QA environments, a product backlog, a team.... At that point, does it matter what kind of project built the existing increment?* Extend that thought to the first sprint -- does it matter what kind of project set up the environment, selected the platform, built up a product backlog, as long as you don't have a fixed plan?\nScrum delivers \"an increment of potentially releasable product.\" In a large enterprise business systems organization, the work to take that product to production release might be waterfall-ish, as might the activity to close the project itself...while the life of the product continues in other projects or in production support.\n*I'll answer my own question: sometimes it matters, because waterfall projects sometimes don't design for sustainability.

As a more lean approach I guess that starting with Kanban will be less painful in this case, as it can be initially applied on top of any waterfall to focus on continues improvement. If you do it right, you will start to gradually move towards a more agile environment and will probably end up with something very similar to Scrum. The other alternative will be to start with Scrum, but it can be more stressful if you try to blend it with waterfall, since Scrum requires much more dedication and organizational alignment to get it right.\nLog in or register to post comments"

   "messages": "07:52 pm November 22, 2015\nIn Waterfall, each phase is a project in itself, where one has to manage scope, quality, and time to achieve the goals of that phase. For e.g. in requirements phase, the goal is to receive sign-offs on functional (BRDs, FRS) and non-functional (NFRs, Tech specs) requirements through respective documentation. Each phase in a waterfall model is few weeks to months. This can be managed better by taking an Agile approach to each phase. For instance, the requirements phase can be broken down into manageable EPICs to User Stories like sizes and worked in 2-3 week sprints. Further, a Sprint team can be identified and assigned for each of the waterfall phases. At the end of each phase (or each sprint), the team can have Sprint review meetings and retrospection meetings to ensure subsequent phases are optimally assigned and worked on. This is how you would then use the Agile approach in a traditional waterfall model.\nRegards,\nViral Sodha\nLog in or register to post comments"

I practiced the Scrum, Nexus and Developer open exams until I could consistently ace all three. As a \"traditional\" software developer, my biggest roadblock was needing to learn testing concepts, which I had limited prior exposure to.\nActually, I'd be curious to know if the PSPO does something like that as well. Are there multiple \"specializations\" of Product Owners like there are with Developers, or is it closer to a Scrum Master with a single dedicated role?

   "title": "Estimating Volume of Work for Product Backlog Items",
   "messages": "08:10 pm March 10, 2017\nHello,\nI recently gave my PSM 1 exam and I recall reading that the Development Team estimates the volume of work for each Product Backlog item. With regard to this, I have two questions:\nThis is how my understanding goes - During Pre-sprint the Product Owner gathers requirements from the Customer and puts them into the Product Backlog in the form of User Stories. The User Stories are ordered based on a factor deemed appropriate by the Product Owner. The team need not wait till the Product Backlog is 100 percent complete (Product Backlog is never complete - it is dynamic, continuously changing and improving), to begin a Sprint. They could begin the Sprint as soon as the Product Backlog is mature enough with the initial stories.\nDuring Sprint Planning, the Development Team estimates the capacity of work they could do in the Sprint in \"Points\". They select a couple of items from the top of the Product Backlog (as the top most items will be of higher priority and more detailed). After selecting the items for the Sprint, the Development Team would next estimate the volume of work for each item\nQuestion 1 - What would they do if the total volume of work for the selected items exceeds their initial capacity of work for the Sprint? Would they replace some of the selected items with some other items from the Product Backlog; or would they change their initially estimated capacity of work for the Sprint to suit the total volume of work for the selected items?\nQuestion 2 - Are there any free resources that teach how to \"estimate volume of work in terms of points\"? I am asking this because if I were a Scrum Master, I am likely to get a question from the Development Team on how they are supposed to determine the points for an item...\nThanks."

Scaled Scrum is still Scrum, and it's best to think of it a a way to get around the 3-9 team member requirement. If you have a \"team\" of 18 people, you could split it up into three teams of 6 members, each with their own scrum process. Then the teams themselves are \"nexus members\" which also have their own scrum process. If you grasp that concept, then Nexus and Scrum become extremely similar.\nPSD has some reading suggestions and public classes. In particular I found it important to focus on the Architecture, Test-first Development and Testing portions. While I can't recommend a specific book, those three concepts make lots of appearances throughout the exam., in addition to the basic Scrum framework.\nI am not familiar with the PSPO certification, but the reading list and public classes are available at their respective links.\nRemember too that there's going to be a lot more material for the PSM series, because it is the direct competitor to the CSM/CSP certifications and the most popular CSM certification. More than 80% of Scrum.org certifications are issued in the PSM series, so they get the majority of the attention.\nLog in or register to post comments"

   "messages": "12:41 pm March 11, 2017\nJust passed the PSPO I exam.\nI read a lot about how to clear the exam after not making it through in the first attempt. Here is all what I did:\n1. Understand each and every statement in the Scrum Guide. I read it more than 10 times. Read the guide 2-3 times and take tests and then go back and read it again rather than cramming it up.\n2. Try scoring 100% in the open assessments\n3. Attempt exam in \"Real Mode\" on Mikhail Lapshin's Blog. Really helpful in estimating the level of preparation\n4. Just before the exam once you've read the Scrum Guide, I suggest attempting the same quiz in \"Learning Mode\". This really helped in cementing the concepts in the scrum guide.\n5. Read the blogs alongside the preparation as the Scrum Guide is too concise a material if you haven't dealt with Scrum at your workplace\n6. Many people in the forum have recommended reading books. I did not feel the need because I was aware of Scrum basics at my workplace and also I did not have the time. However, my experience suggests that a good book would have definitely improved the score.\nA word of caution though: Don't be complacent by reading the Scrum Guide for the first time (this is what I did). The actual questions in the exam are much tougher than the ones in the open assessments or on Mikhail Lapshin's blog. However, practicing them ensures that you will not miss on the sitters as there is little margin for error. For the tough ones, only the Scrum Guide can save you. I would again recommend to understand each and every statement on the scrum guide as many times possible to crack the tough ones in the exam.\nAlso after you have tried attempting the 80 questions in the actual exam, a button called \"Save and Finish\" appears. Once clicked it directly submits your response and gives you the result. It does not ask for a confirmation. This happened in my first attempt and I could not review any of the questions after I completed answering the 80 questions, as I mistakenly clicked \"Save and Finish\". I would request Scrum.org to add a Confirmation to submit the answers when one clicks \"Save and Finish\"\nAll the best!\nScrum On!"

   "messages": "08:00 am March 10, 2017\nScrum.org offers 7 distinct certifications, 3 of which are advanced levels of the remaining 5. Have you ever wondered just how many certifications are handed out, or how popular certain certifications are? Many certifying bodies issue annual statements for the number of certificates issued each year, but Scrum.org does not appear to openly disclose these numbers. However, they do offer a public Certification List, so the data is publicly available for those who want to dig deep enough.\nIn the spirit of transparency, I've scoured the public lists and put it all together in a usable format. My hope is to support both those who pursue certifications and those employers who look for certifications, by encouraging a better understanding of how people choose to specialize within Scrum. Below, please find the compiled data.\nClick here for black and white version\n* Please note that with the exception of the final table, data from 2009 and 2017 was excluded, as full-year data is not currently available for those years.\n**Data is intended to be used as a guideline, and accuracy may vary with a small margin of error.\nI did notice some interesting trends:\nAs of March 2017, over 100,000 certifications have been issued, and over 237,000 accounts created. Roughly 95,000 individuals have obtained certification.\nIn the last 5 years, interest in most Scrum.org certificates has tripled.\nPSM is about 5.5 times as popular as PSPO, which is 3 times as popular as PSD. PSM certification is 18 times as popular as PSD certification.\nJust 9% of people go for a second certification at all. Of these, only 13% go for an advanced certification.\nAs rare as advanced certifications are, more than half of the people with one advanced certification have earned a second one.\nI hope you find this information as interesting as I do. I’d love to hear what other trends you spot, or feedback on how we can better use this information!"

The information you put together can be very useful to our community, but we wanted to bring to your attention that it is not entirely accurate.\nPlease be aware that while the PSM I has been available since 2009, the PSPO I was only open to students who took the Scrum.org PSPO course until February 2014. This is why the PSPO program did not see as much growth until recent years. Following Scrum, we took time by having a smaller group attempt the assessment first, learned, adapted and improved before opening it up to the public.\nPlease also note that what is now known as the PSM II only became available to the public in July 2016 and what was PSM II became PSM III. More information about this change can be found in this blog post\nI hope we were able to clarify some of these details.

The data I provided is as accurate as I can make it, but it is not perfect and should not be considered an official record, just an approximation.\nThere are small nuances such as multiple users who share a name, multiple certifications for the same credential, or even people creating multiple accounts. Then you have things like the PSM I/II/III having data for 2009, where these three exams didn't exist together at that time. All of these things introduce errors, and those errors add up.\nAs you mentioned, the certifications have also changed over time, and that isn't clearly reflected in raw data either. I was personally aware of the PSM II/III change last year, but this is the first time I've heard of past changes to the PSPO lineup. Not all of these changes are well known to the public, and I really do appreciate the clarification.\nAnyone looking for trends should definitely keep those points in mind.\nLog in or register to post comments"

However if they choose the sprint length to be greater than 30 days(1 calendar month) then its a responsibility of a Scrum master to pitch in and advise the team that as per Scrum Guidelines the Increments should be delivered within 30 calendar days or less i.e the sprint should not be greater then 1 calendar month.\nComing onto Product Owner. it's always his decision to priorities the requirements in order to get the maximum benefits (ROI) from the product and the development team. The Scrum Master should guide the PO to understand how this can be achieved in an empirical manner as per Scrum Guidelines. So in that way Product Owner would be able to priorities the requirements as per the development teams capacity/ability.\nAs more is learned the development team can improve on determining what is the optimal sprint length they can adapt to deliver the max value.\nRegards,\nRajat\nLog in or register to post comments"

   "messages": "01:26 pm March 8, 2017\nIn the Scrum Guide it states:\nThe Product Owner is the sole person responsible for managing the Product Backlog. Product Backlog management includes:\nClearly expressing Product Backlog items;\nOrdering the items in the Product Backlog to best achieve goals and missions;\nOptimizing the value of the work the Development Team performs;\nEnsuring that the Product Backlog is visible, transparent, and clear to all, and shows what the Scrum Team will work on next; and,\nEnsuring the Development Team understands items in the Product Backlog to the level needed.\nThe Product Owner may do the above work, or have the Development Team do it. However, the Product Owner remains accountable.\nSo this last line concerns me. A layman might interpret this to mean if the PO is disengaged, can't be bothered, or is just not very good as a PO, then they can have the team do the work of the PO, albeit remaining accountable.\nDoes this not then make the role of the PO moot? The team look to the PO for backlog, for direction and alignment on the delivery of value through the achievement of Sprint Goals through the implementation of backlog. The backlog can change to achieve the Sprint Goal, but the PO role is the role accountable for value delivered through the implementation of backlog to achieve a Sprint Goal.\nThe PO role is responsible for working with the customers and stakeholders to understand their needs, and then to articulate this in such a way that the team understands what needs to be delivered. This is then further refined in backlog refinement.\nNone of this precludes the team talking to the 'real' customer, but the PO role is there for a reason, and if we give the PO carte blanche to delegate any or all of this role to the team, and simply make the PO accountable, then this sort of defeats the objective of the role in my view. Sort of like a manager that is accountable, but diets the team to do all the work... Not that that ever happens :-)\nI invite PSTs to provide their thoughts on this topic.

Many practitioners call for a CPO, but each team retains it's own PO. Of course we could argue the merits of one way vs the other, and we'd all have valid learning points, but from a single team perspective, which is the Scrum Guide, I am of the viewpoint that a PO must be full time, fully engaged, and doing the role of a PO, and not delegating that role to the Team, who are focussed on delivery of the value prioritized by the PO.\nLog in or register to post comments"

It could be nice if the PO makes his best to have crystal-clear PBI and clear UAT in order to help the Dev Team.\nIf the PBI are very complexe to describe and the business model is also very hard to optimize, but easy to implement by a Dev Team of 9 rock-star Devs, the bottleneck will probably be on the PO side.

He seemed receptive, and I heard nothing for some time. Then, about 3-5 weeks after that, I had a follow up meeting. He explained to me that \"changes were coming\", and within 30 days the COO/CTO stepped in to lead development (while CIO remained on SCRUM team). I thought we had achieved a measure of success, as this new leaders style was pragmatic, open, honest, and direct.\nNow here we're on another 2-4ish months since the change, and old habits are starting to creep back in. The new Development manager (COO/CTO) has \"backed away\" from architecture decisions (due to lack of knowledge), and the old oppressive and blocking habits are recurring.\nSo now, after listening to several books on motivation & habits, I have come to several conclusions:\n1) As long as this team member continues to hold a grip over the flow of work (through the secrecy surrounding the architecture design, and exerting power of position), work will not get done in a timely manner.\n2) Team morale is in the toilet, and if this team member were to leave every member would simultaneously rejoice, and experience fear and consternation about the knowledge gap.\n3) He has become the strongest uniting force (common enemy) on our team that I have experienced during my tenure.\nAny suggestions?\nLog in or register to post comments"

How do you, as a Scrum Master, get the Scrum Team back on track when things don't go exactly as planned?\nTo that, end, I have two suggestions:\nRead some Scrum Master blogs. Find out what problems other real scrum masters face, and the tips and tricks they have found effective to solve them. Don't look for \"scrum solutions\"; focus on real solutions to scrum problems.\nPractice the hell out of the Scrum and Nexus Open exams. If you have the PSM I, you're presumably scoring at least 85% on the Scrum Open. Ramp it up to 100% and add the Nexus Open to your practice roster. You can take a look at the Developer Open and Product Owner Open exams as well as they're helpful for Scrum Masters, but I didn't find them necessary within the context of the PSM II.\nLog in or register to post comments"

   "title": "My experience tackling the PSM II as a first certification",
   "messages": "07:58 pm March 7, 2017\nHello all. I recently decided to sit for the PSM II exam with no prior scrum certifications, and was able to pass. I’ve seen a few posts here about how to prepare for the gap between the two tests, but not a lot of people who might want to jump straight into an advanced certification without tackling the topics progressively. It’s certainly not an easy route, but it’s a possible one. I’d like to share my experience with all of you, and I’m happy to answer any questions.\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\nTo start my routine off, I took the Scrum Open test. Then I took the Developer Open test the next day, once I had forgotten the Scrum Open questions. I did this without reading the Scrum Guide. As expected, I bombed both of them horribly. I think I scored around the 30% mark. However I was able to get a feel for the kinds of questions asked, and an understanding of Scrum methods I’ve seen within my organization as well as vocabulary that were brand new to me. Now I had a baseline for my knowledge, and I sat down and read through the Scrum Guide, twice. At the end I tested with the Scrum Open again, getting a score of around a 70%.\nI then proceeded to take a 2-day Agile training seminar. This offered through my work and was NOT a Scrum seminar, though it covered many Scrum practices. Some of the information was dated or related to other methodologies, so terms like “Sprint 0” and “Hardening Sprint” were thrown around. This turned out to be a blessing in disguise because as I continued to take the Scrum Open exams, I was forced to identify the differences between “Scrum” and “Agile.\"\nOnce the seminar was over, I took the Scrum Open two more times, getting 95%+ each time. This was the point I moved over to the Nexus Open and Nexus Guide. I don’t have much to say on this one; it took me about a day to get to 95%+ mastery. Nexus was a relatively easy concept after mastering the core Scrum Master topics.\nFinally, I looked up as much information as I could find on the PSM II. In 2016 the PSM II exam was drastically changed, and most of the information I found was related to what has since become the PSM III. Luckily a few blog writers have updated their articles to keep their information relevant to the correct exam. This helped me understand what I was getting into a little better, and how the PSM II would differ from the Scrum Open.\nAfter all that, I took the PSM II, and...failed.\nFor all the practice and preparation, the PSM II is difficult! However, failure is not something that should be feared; it should encourage inspection and adaptation. Since Scrum.org provided me the sections I was weak in, I had a general idea of what to look for. Armed with these new questions and categories, I spent several hours doing research and filling in the knowledge gaps I identified.\nA few hours later, I retook the exam. I did this within 24 hours of the first attempt. This gave me time to quickly power through the questions I was confident on during the last attempt, and focus more time onto those I was less certain about or the new questions from the pool that weren’t on my previous attempt.\nThis time I passed.\nWould I recommend you follow in my footsteps and ignore the lower certifications? No, not really. Take the PSM I. Take the SPS. Then look towards the PSM II afterward. Work your way up rather than throwing yourself right into the thick of things. The PSM II builds off the other certifications so by taking them in order, you can build up your knowledge with checkpoints. Additionally, it means you can walk away from a failed upper-level exam with existing certifications in hand.\nBest of luck with your next certification!\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\nSo to recap my process:\nScrum Open blind\nReview the Scrum Guide\nScrum Open to 70%\nFormal training\nScrum Open to 100%\nNexus Open blind\nRead the Nexus Guide\nNexus Open to 100%\nPSM II – Fail\nScrum Open, Nexus Open, Research\nPSM II – Pass"

We're working on rebuilding a few systems that our organization already uses, but which are not ideal; this new project will merge all three systems into one, with different points of entry. We have already hired an outside firm to do UX research on the pre-existing systems in order to determine what is and is not working for our users.\nNow, we are looking to move forward with some UX/ UI design for the new product. We are still a ways off from being finished, but are starting to work on the front-end framework that we will be using in the final product. As such, we'd like the visual design to reflect the direction we end up taking as soon as possible. More to the point, we would like for our software and UI design to reflect the kind of interactions that will be ideal for our users.\nAs we don't have a full design team in-house, we're considering three options: hiring an outside firm to work with us in an agile fashion, hiring a contractor to join the team for a period of time (either full-time or at least 3 days/ week), or a hybrid of the two approaches.\nHas anyone worked on a large-scale project with a 3rd party design partner like this and, if so, how was the work tied to the development process? How would folks suggest moving forward and what pitfalls could you advise us against?\nSome of the problems we can anticipate include:\nSlowing down the pace of development we've already established\nMissing key user experience issues and opportunities due to only working within the limited set of features of each sprint\nHaving the expense of this work run away from us (due to lots of iterations and refactoring)\nCommunication issues between the designer/s and the development team"

That said, this does seem to hit a pitfall of not considering the whole of the user experience and user flows as they progress through the software.\nTo be clear, this would not just involve \"designing one layer,\" but figuring out how to integrate either a firm or a contractor into our process. I'm just not sure how this works with scrum. It was a lot easier to sort this out with a waterfall-type project.\nWe already are delivering built and tested increments each sprint, but we're trying to figure out how to integrate a more polished design process without continuing to kick the can down the road. Even more critically, considering that UX is a lot more than just look and feel, we're concerned that our current process of test-driven development is leaving the experience of a real human user out of the process until way too late in the game, which is why we'd like to involve UI/ UX experts or an expert as soon as we can.\nDoes that make any more sense?\nLog in or register to post comments"

In the long term, the team's overall velocity and experience working together can help get to common estimate sooner.\nOut of curiosity, though - are both iOS and Android devs working simultaneously on one User Story? If they aren't, is it possible to break the User Story into one for either platform? It could probably fall under the INVEST mnemonic still.\nLog in or register to post comments"

However, the weekend seems to \"erase\" some information from some Scrum Team Members, and maybe you will loss some time by recapitulating things you already talked about last Friday. On the other hand, I also had some Team member coming up with new ideas on Mondays, because they had time to sleep a night over it.

By doing so, you take into account people often tend to start their weekend early on Friday afternoon, and will be back with their thoughts to work not until lunchtime on Mondays. Having Sprint Planning, Retro and Review on these \"special\" days could tend to decrease in concentration, efficiency and will probably lead to mistakes. However, some teams already told me, it \"feels\" odd to start on such uneven days.\nSo, it depends and you totally should ask your team what would work best for them and support their decision.\nKnowing this is only one half of the truth. There are things outside the borders of Scrum you should take into account:\n- Having breaks every now and then during your meetings will increase concentration. This can be having a break every hour or having a \"red card\" anyone who feels sleepy can raise to ask for a break, or....\n- Order Team Pizza for lunch could keep the discussion rolling and reduces the interruption\n- End the day with a get together will increase the fun, too\n- Clarify how you want to manage interruptions like E-Mails or phone calls\n- Try to stay as focused as possible to shorten your events. A focused 2 h sprint planning is worth much more than a chewy 4h long one\nand several several more... In my opinion, this is more a \"How to have an efficient meeting\" question, than a \"What Would Scrum Say\" one, right? ;)\nHope I could help you\nLog in or register to post comments"

There are 10 professional (developers and QA) and the Product Owner. How to distribute people between development teams? Choose all applicable variants:\n1) 1 team of 10 people (because there is no reason to divide)\n2) 2 teams of 6 and 4 people (the professionals after a short meeting decided this is the best variant)\n3) 2 teams of 6 and 4 people (because it is good to have all the QAs in a separate team)\n4) 3 teams of 4,3 and 3 people (each team is cross-functional)\nAnd the correct answers are 2 and 4.\nHowever, I disagree with 4th answer. After reading the Nexus guide, it became really clear that with more teams there is more complexity: \"If they work in different teams, how will they integrate\ntheir work and test the Integrated Increment? These challenges appear when two teams are\nintegrating, and become significantly more difficult with three or more teams.\"\nSo, why is the answer 4 correct if 3 teams creates more complexity? I'd just choose (2) - I don't see any other correct answers here.\nAnyone has a different insight?"

But it does not violate any scrum rule.\nAnswer 1 is wrong because you cannot have more than 9 team members in one Scrum Team.\nAnswer 2 is aligned with Scrum and hence is a correct answer.\nAnswer 3 is wrong we do not separate scrum teams by role. A scrum team with just QA persons is not a Scrum team because it is not cross-functional.\nAnswer 4 is does not break any Scrum rules. While it is true that more teams is equivalent to more integration and coordination effort, this is not always a bad thing. Product backlog management in Nexus focuses on removing or minimizing integration effort. So having three teams is not necessarily a bad thing. Another way of looking at this answer is - would you have a team that breaks a Scrum rule (answer 3) or have a team configuration that does not break Scrum rules but may be more complicated to manage? I would go with answer 4.\nLog in or register to post comments"

Like, I was helped by friends like you all who shared their views and experiences about this exam, I must pay back to this community by sharing my two cents to aspiring colleagues who would like to appear for this exam.\nAlthough there are many other friends and colleagues who scored 100% as well and they have their experiences, I would like to share my feedback as well:\nPlease find below my feedback points:\n1. This exam is real eye-opener!\n2. Just 'knowing' about SCRUM is not enough.\n3. SCRUM Guide is like Holy Bible! Read it minimum 5 times with slow pace and understanding meaning of each sentence. Ask question to your self about understanding of each section therein.\n4. A few questions from the Open exam also appear, which brings some breather in the course of writing the exam :).\n5. Please do solve the open exam at least 8 to 10 times each time with score of 100%.\n6. Please do watch videos of trainings on YouTube.\n7. Of course having some experience of working in Agile SCRUM team previously helps extensively in applying experience into answering questions that are more practical in nature, like e.g.: who maintains the Burn Down Chart , or What does the trend line mean in the chart.\n8. Also, some questions are there where you have to select multiple answers but no minimum selection choice is mentioned.. and there I feel bit worried. If they ask 'Select any two' - this makes easy.. to filter choices basis understanding.\n9. Also, like many have said, this exam is about understanding various aspects of SCRUM in real life and not just a theory in the Scrum guide.\n10. Once you start the exam: don't panic or rush. While some questions from the open exam would appear and they will create a time space for you to relax and pay focus on other difficult questions!\n10a. Read the question and choices very clearly. (esp. words like : NOT :) ). Like e.g.: which of the following roles are not in a scrum team.\n10b. while writing exam, switch off your ph, outlook, office communicator or any other modes of communication that may distract your focus.\n10c. When in doubt, book mark the question but then always know that your first thought about a choice usually is the correct one.\nI would like to sincerely thank all friends and colleagues here who shared their feedback and experience and I can clearly say that without this it was really difficult to write this exam.\nWith Best Regards,\nHemant"

I was quite unsure about a lot of questions (33 bookmarked first, after revisiting maybe 10 left), but I passed with 92,5 %, so my assumptions were right quite often, it seems.\nFor preparation I followed a lot of the tipps given by Hermant and others, so thanks a lot to all of you. Some additional points:\n1. I trained the timeboxes of 45 seconds or less to answer a question in the open assessement. After 8-10 times I could finish it within 10 minutes and 100%.\n2. I used a timer-app to train it (in my case the android \"ok timer\" did a good job).\n3. Such trained, I ran through the 80 questions of the exam in 45 minutes, so I had 15 minutes left to revise difficult questions.\n4. The exam is a bit different from the open-version: You can bookmark questions with a checkbox (no browser bookmarks), it is quite handy.\nAs many have said: The Scrum Guide is the most important document and you should'nt only read, but really work through it many times. Forum questions help to get a critical understanding of each sentence, so you can answer questions from different point of views.\nThe PO part is mainly about product value, responsibilities of the PO and so on. I didn't read too much specific literature about PO, mainly the book of Roman Pichler and some other documents that outline the specific tasks of the PO (product backlog-management, agile product planning and stuff like that).

   "messages": "04:18 pm July 20, 2016\nHi,\nRecently I cleared PSM-I certification from scrum.org with 92% score in first attempt. Let me brief how I prepared for the exam.\n1. Scrum Guide – The first and the foremost guide for the preparation is the Scrum Guide itself. You can expect 80% to 90% of the question from this guide. Don’t just read it. Understand every bit of it. This is the essence of the scrum. Every sentence in the guide is a probable question in the exam.\nDuring the days of my preparation, I used to listen to the audio version of the Scrum Guide whenever possible (eg: while commuting to office). This helped me in fully understanding the Scrum Guide.\n2. Open Assessment – Take Scrum Open Assessment until you get 100% score consistently. This will help you understand the pattern of the question. In the real exam, you can expect 5 to 10 questions from this Open Assessment.\n3. Books – There are plenty of books available on Scrum. Definitely reading these books will improve your scrum awareness. But in exam preparation point of view ready many scrum books may lead you in confused state. All your answers must be adhere to Scrum Guide.\nOne book I used for my preparation was Scrum Narrative and PSM Exam Guide. This book explain the Scrum Guide in narrative way and is very specific to PSM exam. There are 250+ practice questions too.\n4. Practice Test – There are few PSM Exam simulator are available in the net. The one I used is made by Mikhail Lapshin. This has Learning mode (which show you the correct answer with explanation) and Real mode, and it is totally Free.\nGive complete focus on your preparation. Dedicate yourself for this for one/two weeks, avoiding all other distractions. Definitely you can pass this exam with good score.\nAll the best!\nLog in or register to post comments"

The calculation involves measures for User Value, Time Value, Risk Reduction / Opportunity Enablement Value, and Job Size::\nWSJF = (User Value + Time Value + RROE Value) / Job Size\nUser Value, Time Value, and RROE Value are meant to be numbers from 1 to 10.\nI'm looking for some worked examples of this. In particular, I would like to see how values of 1 to 10 are assigned to the variables on the numerator, and how the Job Size is measured.

The question is, how are the variables to be populated in an unbiased and credible manner?\nThe article you linked to (thanks!) has the advantage of at least making things more democratic, in that planning poker is used to agree the values that certain attributes will hold. Yet clearly that could still result in \"prioritization by persuasion\". In Scrum, forecasts are applied by the Development Team to the smallest batch possible - the Sprint Backlog - in order to contain such estimation risk.\nI reckon WSJF should be contrasted with more objective methods of backlog management such as innovation accounting, whereby Product Backlog order is informed by actionable metrics derived from A/B tests and the release of MVP.\nLog in or register to post comments"

They should also be adjusted when strategic drivers change or if something happens that change the time-sensitivity of some Product Backlog Items.\nIn other words, give these values a best-before date.

   "messages": "06:06 am July 1, 2016\nHi Ian,\nI’m not an expert in SAFe, but based on the literature on value management, and the structure of that formula, using relative “Job Size” should be OK; something like story points.\nGenerally, “value” is simply proportional to the benefits to cost ratio. In cases that do not involve procurement and costs are only for human resources with the less or more same level of salary, we can easily replace cost with “job size”. If we assume that the same number of people usually works on items, then we can even replace “job size” with duration.\nThere are a few things about the formula that I’m not comfortable with:\n1. Risk is only considered for the numerator (benefits), while each risk has the potential to affect both the benefits and the cost; e.g. a risk that may cause you to spend three times more effort on the item.\n2. There’s a risk of double counting the benefits with those three elements: User-Business Value and Time Criticality are not independent of each other.\n3. There's an issue with the suggested way of normalizing in SAFe: assigning 1 to the item with lowest state in each column practically impacts the weight of that criteria. For example, if items are generally more time critical in our project, the importance of time_criticality automatically reduces in this formula, which is not right. The main problem is that we can simply use relative values with any linear normalization method, as long as we’re only dividing and multiplying them, while this formula is adding them up.\nAnyway, I still have a bigger problem with this formula. When it’s difficult to measure something, people usually break down the calculation into smaller pieces and try again. Sometimes it’s not the right way, and we’re only fooling ourselves. In case of measuring value for items in a project, it’s probably enough to simply assign a relative, intuitive amount to “benefits”, and divide it by the size to get the “value”. Some people are not comfortable with it, because it’s subjective. However, the more detailed formula is still subjective, there’s more room for biases, and worst of all, creates the illusion of precision which is always dangerous.\nLog in or register to post comments"

In most cases, there's no way to empirically know that you've made the right decision until after you've made it and executed (to the point above that some values decay over time if not acted on and will need revisited). If you're feeling particularly uneasy about the decision at hand, why not cook up two matrices with more granular articulations - then exercised independently to see if there are conflicts!\nLog in or register to post comments"

Just to I hope, clarify, the essence here is the difference between a predictive development approach and an agile approach. As we know agile development is adaptive - we make decisions on what we actually know to be the case, and adapt what we are doing based on that. The use of the term predictive here is to mean that you would attempt to predict the course of the development at the start, with designs, plans, dependencies and gate reviews etc all in place before development work starts, a la waterfall.\nLog in or register to post comments"

   "messages": "07:16 pm March 3, 2017\nHere is my suggestion on this:\n1. In your case Sprint Goal should be more like 'Reskin the website for a section e.g. Apparel section in case of e-commerce website'. The reason why 10 or some other number shouldn't be included in sprint goal as it doesn't allow dev team to renegotiate the scope if required.\n2. Definition of done means it is potentially releasable. So, I am sure in doing reskin you must have a criteria which if met then the the increment is showed as Done.\n3. Potentially releasable doesn't mean that the whole thing should be released to the market. It means that the done increment is ready(coded, tested, documented etc.) and whenever it suits the most, it can be delivered to the client/market.\nLog in or register to post comments"

You can therefore always come up with your own system. To argue for consensus\nimplies regression; where does consensus come from? Someone or some group or tribe always has to come up with it in the first place, so why not you?\nAcademic 'scientists' however even though they agree with the Nietzschian theory that group consensus decides morality, cannot accept even the possibility of the\nfurther conclusion, and settle for group consensus morality as dogmatic thereby acting in the same way as the religious whom they despise on this very issue.\nThis is of course complete and utter hypocrisy, but more important is the issue of science.\nThe academic community has been polluting science to make it appear as if their version of morality, carefully hidden by the words 'sane' and 'insane', are objective\nin the scientific sense. And that is simply not so. The words 'sane' and 'insane' coming from a 'reputable' scientist always turn out to be nothing but moral\njudgements in disguise. (Example : When you're violent, you're implicitly insane. Why? There's no science; Violence is _bad_, a moral judgement. The lie is the fact that they\nclaim it as a science. Therein lies great suffering.)\nBut that was not the reason I got banned.\nI got banned when I started questioning Agile methodologies.\nAgile methodologies, even though they're 'just' software development methodologies, have taken up the meme for religious belief; That's where the human impulse\ntowards this now apparently resides.\nAnd so RogierSoft will market a new software development methodology : The Beautiful Waterfall.\nIt will replace this meme with a new one.

However, the SM does not have any decision-making authority on this.\nThe team size should be based around skill set, communication, and coordination considerations. Complexity of projects and technology specialization are considerations for identifying a team that is cross-skilled as a team in order to deliver value to the business.\nMature Agile organizations can promote the self-organization of teams along these guidelines. Otherwise, it is my experience that organizations usually decide on team rosters, and their decisions are not always wise or well-informed.

In general trust the Development Team; they will know when the team is too large to coordinate efforts effectively or too small to meet the cross functional needs. An organization that truly supports the Agile philosophy will trust and empower the team to do so.

The existing team might organize into as many as 4 Scrum Teams or as few as 2.\nAlso, explain the \"whys\" behind the recommended Development Team size for Scrum to your Scrum Team. Scrum recommends a Development Team size of 3-9 people because a Dev Team of 2 people is typically too small to be cross-functional and to justify the overhead of the events and roles in Scrum. When there are more than 9 people on the Dev Team, communication usually starts to break down because there are too many people to work closely with.\nLog in or register to post comments"

For instance, when a developer needs to come back to the dropped story when trying to do some bug fixes, how they would efficiently find exactly what they need? I agree that a user story could be an extremely helpful communication stimuli for the team. More precisely how would you preserve a user story for further reference? I, for example, collect all the done stories in a sliding plastic panel shelf which have turned to be a very helpful asset to our low-tech documentation approach.

Perhaps the best way to trace the original requirement would be by the corresponding acceptance tests. However, there's nothing to stop a PO or the team from archiving old stories any way they like. They can also mandate that they be documented a particular way in the Definition of Done.\nLog in or register to post comments"

   "messages": "09:51 pm February 26, 2017\nHello,\nA client asked me to explain (in 1-page) how LeanUX works with Scrum.\nMy answer is below.\nI basically see LeanUX working in advance of Scrum, or LeanUX working quite independently of Scrum.\nI would be very thankful for any comments / insights / points of view from this community.\nThanks so much!\nBolt-On vs. Independent LeanUX Function\nBOLT-ON: Feature Focused Designed\nLeanUX can be applied as a ‘bolt-on’ to the Scrum function. In this format LeanUX operates ‘ahead‘ of development, in a staggered sprint approach, providing ‘just-in-time design’ to a development team.\nThe Product Owner (of the Scrum development team) chooses a User Story (or a Large User Story/Epic) from the Product Backlog for the LeanUX team to work on. The LeanUX team then works an iteration ahead of the development team.\nScrum development teams operate best when they have high-level wireframes, designs, and/or prototyping work that provide additional context and transparency behind what they need to develop. LeanUX provides these artifacts at the commencement of each development sprint, giving the Scrum team a head start in thinking through the idea through from a user-centric approach, and providing some much needed visualization around the ‘words’ of the business case.\nBut there are some definite cons to the ‘bolt-on’ approach.\nOne of the key principles of LeanUX is problem-focused design. When LeanUX is closely tied to a feature-focused development methodology such as Scrum, it tends to become feature-focused as well.\nDoing this type of ‘just-in-time’ design runs the risk of both teams losing sight of the big picture. And a high level view of system is critical to everyone’s success.\nINDEPENDENT: Problem Focused Design\nUnlike the ‘bolt-on’ LeanUX function, an Independent LeanUX function conducts its work as a completely separate work stream. It focuses on the whole system and the large problems/opportunities that exist within it (instead of working within a feature constrained box). Additionally, it is expertly aware of the overall strengths and weaknesses of the system against competitor offerings in the space.\nAn Independent LeanUX team typically maintains a ‘living prototype’, and adds to this incrementally with solution-providing Minimum Viable Products (MVPs) over time. Now, you may be thinking, “Having a full living prototype looks an awful lot like a waterfall process- and we’re agile!” I believe this to be a false dilemma. Scrum works best when the team understands the big picture it is building toward. (“Are we building a cathedral, or a garage?”).\nAlso, the living prototype does not in any way represent a “list of requirements” for the Scrum team to dutifully follow. Optimally the Product Owner (of the Scrum development team) will leverage learning’s from the living prototype to inform the Product Backlog, but the Product Owner is not compelled to draw ideas from just this one source.\nSome items that the LeanUX team may feel are worthy of investigation, may not be of similar interest to the Product Owner at the time. LeanUX may choose to focus on an interactive carousel that surfaces product in an exceptionally innovative and useful way for customers, while the Product Owner may have a business requirement to add acceptance of a new credit card. The Product Backlog will contain many items- and it will continue to be prioritized by the Product Owner as s/he deems appropriate.\nFurther distancing the living prototype from a “list of requirements” is the reality that any MVP chosen by the Product Owner, needs to be validated, refined and iterated on by the Scrum team as the increment gets built.\nThe living prototype should be a source of inspiration and insight for the Scrum team. It should help the Scrum team extract more detail around a business case, help it to put more context and transparency behind what it needs to develop, all while providing a high level view of the system’s possibilities."

While the PSM I may have some questions regarding multiple Scrum teams, please bear in mind that scaled Scrum is still Scrum, and the original framework and concepts thereof still apply. The answers to those questions can be arrived at through interpretation and extrapolation from the information presented in the Scrum Guide. Please note that all Scrum.org Level I assessments use the most recent version of the English Scrum Guide as the source for questions regarding the rules, artifacts, events, and roles of Scrum. However, reading the Scrum Guide alone is not enough for someone to pass a Professional Scrum Assessment. Questions often ask test-takers to interpret information and apply it to challenging situations, so knowledge gained from personal experience and other sources is typically needed.\nWe hope you will find this information helpful.

   "messages": "07:08 pm February 23, 2017\nI have over 14 years experience as a project manager at various creative / marketing agencies. While I have a little direct experience with development, almost all of the projects I've worked on in my career have been creative development, production, digital strategy, social media, etc. – basically marketing and advertising. And in terms of methodology, I've used waterfall because that's what the industry dictates. My current role is actually overseeing a project management department (which I built), so I've got a kind of PMO role today, overseeing my teams executions, while interacting at a senior leadership level across the agency.\nLately, I've been really interested in moving over to software development and becoming a Scrum Master. Frankly, I'm bored and frustrated with the creative agency space, and have been for some time. I'm much more interested in being involved in building things, and in an industry that continues to grow exponentially (read: better career growth). I'm keenly interesting in making a career shift, and personally feel like this is a viable move, the more I read about Scrum.\nI understand and agree that a traditional PM does not equate to an SM, but I feel I have a lot of transferrable qualities to a potential SM role: removing barriers for the team, working with stakeholders / PO-like people, coaching & support, facilitation, balancing & educating on process, prioritization, leadership, etc. My friends are devs and they're supportive of the idea, in that they agree I could be successful in the role. While I lack the depth of technical knowledge today, I do have a passion for tech and am generally tech-minded. Also if it matters, I'm in the Boston area, and not looking to move.\nAs of today, I'm considering going for a CSM at some point in the near future, but I'm concerned about the real world viability of making the move. Is this a pipe dream? Am I basically looking at starting my career over from scratch with only entry level possibilities? What kind of marketability might I have between solid career experience plus a certification? Are Scrum Masters even really that high in demand, or did I fall victim to the internet's misguidance?\nAny thoughts or feedback are welcome - thanks in advance."

All face barriers to agility, including stage-gated cultures which many are too vested in to readily change.\nThe creatives may be less familiar with Scrum than the mainstream IT industry, but they tend to have an advantage in that they are more market-facing and have a great potential to be feedback-driven. I suggest promoting change from that angle, such as by promoting entrepreneurship and the Lean Startup approach, finding MVP's and reducing leaps of faith. Scrum might be introduced once that potential for better creativity through innovation is recognized and sponsored.\nLog in or register to post comments"

Unfortunately, the application turned to be full of bugs and in such a mess, with no version control or anything, it was a complete spaghetti code which would cost us extra time fixing it than creating a new one from scratch.\nI decided to hire 6 developers, 2 iOS developers, 2 Android developers, 1 back-end developer, and 1 front-end developer, and now I'm completely lost about the application's backlog, I started to write few epics using (Axosoft), but when it comes to giving specific tasks for Android / iOS developers, I get lost whether I should separate the teams in Axosoft or specify the epics with two different subitems; one for iOS and one for Android.\nHere is the current progress I made so far."

If so, then perhaps each product could have its own product backlog. Perhaps not.\nIf you split the developers into two teams, do you believe that each team will be cross-functional and self-sufficient? Will they, without any help from developers outside their 3-person team, be able to turn product backlog items into a useful increment of working software? This is one characteristic that Scrum teams are expected to have and that you might want to consider. If the split teams are not self-sufficient, what will be the impact of inter-team dependencies on their ability to focus on their own sprint?\nWhat do you think will be the impact of the size of the team if you split (3 developers per team) versus if you don't (6 developers in a team)?\nIf you don't split the team, and keep it as one, do you believe the developers will agree to have a team goal, rather than split goals for the Android and iOS developers? Scrum encourages team responsibility, not individual responsibility. Will the Android developers be uncomfortable at the idea of the entire team being held responsible for iOS work?\nLog in or register to post comments"

They won't be pair-programming or anything, I'm pretty sure they will just have extra free time until the iOS software is finished and wait to start with the Android version.\nAnd how come dividing the teams makes it an individual responsibility? I imagine that both of them are working in parallel to achieve the same goal \"but with different technologies\". isn't it more efficient that way?\n@Ian Mitchell\nI just needed to organize the development process by implying a development method in order to produce a good quality software. Please remember that I mentioned earlier that this product belongs to a Saudi company with Saudi stakeholders and owners, they have nothing to do with software development.

   "messages": "09:24 am February 24, 2017\nHi Abdalla, this sounds like a difficult start for your project. From your post I get the impression you don't yet have buy-in or understanding from your organisation and team about what Scrum is and what it involves or that you don't have the Scrum roles assigned yet.\nFinding the people in your organisation that can fulfil the Scrum roles is essential and educating them in what those roles involve and how the Scrum process is critical. My (painful :-) experience is that if you don't have that level of understanding, roles-assigned and buy-in from the start then the benefits of using Scrum are diluted. It just ends up feeling like a kludge. Like the guide says, Scrum is easy to undersand but difficult to get right.\nFor your backlog question - what does the Product Owner say about the relative importance of Android / IOs implementation - does one have to go to market before the other or released at the same time? if they have to go at the same time then the backlog contains stories that are cross platform and the product owner chooses which cross-platform feature should be built next by the development team. The key thing is, if you are the Scrum Master then you should be working to help the Product Owner organise this backlog, not doing it in isolation from him/her.\nLog in or register to post comments"
